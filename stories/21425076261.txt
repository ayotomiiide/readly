So I need to be able to save a text area to a file. I have to create the textarea in php though since it's dynamic, because it comes from a form of checkboxes. So depending how many checkboxes there are checked, for each one a textarea will be displayed. I'm not sure if I can access the textarea by name since it's echoed in php. When I type something in the text area and hit submit, nothing gets saved to my file.
