<p> CHAPTER  1<br />
</p>
<p> &quot;Um, It's not exactly what I had in mind!&quot;<br />
  Ernie Ross looked ruefully at his imitation fur loincloth and<br />
  flimsy plastic broadsword. &quot;Um, I sort of thought....&quot;<br />
  The girl behind the counter gave Ernie a sour look. &quot;You<br />
  wanted to play the `Goombah the Barbarian' Virtual Reality Game,<br />
  right?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Uh, yeah,&quot; Ernie replied.<br />
  The girl examined a sheet of paper, cracking her gum loudly.<br />
  &quot;In that case, you have to wear the fur loincloth and carry the<br />
  plastic broadsword. It says so right here.&quot;<br />
  Ernie thought about this. &quot;Well, in the ad it said that<br />
  playing the game would be just like being Goombah the Barbarian.<br />
  There'd be monsters and wizards and everything, just like the<br />
  movie!&quot;<br />
  &quot;That's correct,&quot; replied the girl. &quot;Here at the Virtual<br />
  Arcade, we offer simulated reality games of just about any popular<br />
  character or story line. Our huge mainframe computers allow us to<br />
  synthesize any reality in amazingly high resolution, allowing us to<br />
  believably create stories in which YOU can be the main character.<br />
  You can step into the role of a commando, a swashbuckler, a space<br />
  traveler, just about anything that any popular movie or book has<br />
  featured recently. You can act out the role of your favorite<br />
  character, doing anything that character could. You can actually BE<br />
  your favorite fictional character! You can live out your fantasies,<br />
  for only a few dollars a minute!&quot; She seemed to reading from a<br />
  prepared statement.<br />
  &quot;Well...&quot; Ernie was still unsure. He had heard that these<br />
  games were tremendous fun. They had become very popular in the last<br />
  few years. You could now find a Virtual Arcade at just about any<br />
  major shopping mall (they were franchised). Of course, you had to<br />
  pay through the nose to play, but nobody seemed to mind. They were<br />
  just so much FUN...<br />
  &quot;I still feel silly wearing this fur loincloth and carrying<br />
  this big plastic sword,&quot; complained Ernie.<br />
  &quot;That's what Goombah wears in the movie, isn't it?&quot; the girl<br />
  said, looking bored.<br />
  &quot;Well...&quot;<br />
  The girl looked at the clock. &quot;If you don't want to play<br />
  GOOMBAH THE BARBARIAN, I can let you play KILLER LESBIANS FROM<br />
  OUTER SPACE instead. I've got a game starting in ten minutes.&quot;<br />
  &quot;No, no, that's okay,&quot; Ernie protested.<br />
  A chime sounded. &quot;Your game starts in five minutes!&quot; The girl<br />
  warned Ernie, fluffing her hair absently.<br />
  Well, I guess I'm stuck with this, Ernie thought. I paid my<br />
  $47.95; and there's no refund. I hope this turns out to be worth<br />
  the money. Ernie was, after all, just a college student, and didn't<br />
  have money to burn.<br />
  The chime sounded, again, this time more urgently. &quot;Second<br />
  door on your right,&quot; the girl said brightly.<br />
  This is not starting off well at all, Ernie thought, as he<br />
  headed down the hallway. If this doesn't improve real quick, I'm<br />
  going to file a complaint, or something.<br />
  Ernie entered a small cubicle. A technician sat him down in a<br />
  large, comfortable reclining chair, and fitted him with the stereo<br />
  goggles and headset that made Virtual Reality come alive. He even<br />
  added the latest refinement: tactile sensation electrodes, which he<br />
  glued to Ernie's body at strategic locations.<br />
  As Ernie settled into the new visions and sensations that<br />
  awaited him, he began to feel somewhat better. There before him was<br />
  the mysterious landscape that Goombah inhabited in the movies, full<br />
  of forbidding crags and castles shaped like skulls. Of course, none<br />
  of it was actually there, but the illusion was amazingly realistic.<br />
  It was hard to believe it was all just synthesized artificial<br />
  reality. Ernie was impressed. Maybe this will be okay after all, he<br />
  thought. He unsheathed his huge plastic broadsword, preparing to be<br />
  attacked by dragons, wizards, or any of the other fearsome<br />
  mythological characters that Goombah customarily battled.<br />
  Suddenly, Ernie heard a loud, high-pitched bark. He looked<br />
  down and saw a little white dog with a black spot over one eye. The<br />
  dos looked up at him expectantly.  Ernie was not prepared for<br />
  something like this. I'm supposed to be Goombah the Barbarian, he<br />
  thought. Goombah does not have any silly little dog!<br />
  The dog suddenly jumped up into Ernie's arms. He caught it<br />
  automatically. It peered up into his face, as though expecting him<br />
  to do something.<br />
  &quot;This has got to be a mistake&quot;, said Ernie to himself<br />
  exasperatedly. &quot;This dog must be from somebody else's game. What am<br />
  I gonna do with him?&quot; <br />
  Before he could think about the problem any further, a  bright<br />
  light in the sky attracted Ernie's attention. Here it comes, he<br />
  thought, gripping his broadsword tightly. What will it be, a demon,<br />
  a flying dragon? Ernie strained his eyes. It's...a flying saucer?<br />
  Sure enough, it was a flying saucer, looking as though it had come<br />
  straight from an old 1950's science-fiction movie. Ernie was taken<br />
  aback. There weren't supposed to be any flying saucers in Goombah<br />
  the Barbarian!<br />
  The flying saucer quickly landed a few yards in front of<br />
  Ernie, and two space creatures emerged. They seemed to be some kind<br />
  of humanoid reptiles. They reminded Ernie of giant iguanas. The dog<br />
  under Ernie's arm wriggled uncomfortably.<br />
  Ernie frowned. Space creatures? he thought. What am I supposed<br />
  to do with space creatures? This isn't what I was expecting at all!<br />
  Ernie frowned. What kind of game is this, anyway?! The creatures<br />
  began approaching Ernie.<br />
  Maybe I'm supposed to say something, he considered. Suddenly,<br />
  an idea occurred to him. He drew himself up to his full height.<br />
  &quot;Klaatu barada nikto!&quot; he announced.<br />
  One of the space creatures pulled out a ray gun and pointed it<br />
  at him. Hmm, thought Ernie. Maybe that wasn't quite the right thing<br />
  to say. It occurred to Ernie that a strategic retreat might be a<br />
  good idea. He looked around quickly. Unfortunately, the landscape<br />
  of swirling mists and forbidding hills didn't seem to contain<br />
  anyplace to retreat to.<br />
  Ernie turned back to the creatures. &quot;Look, uh, what I said<br />
  about Klaatu, I didn't really mean...&quot; The creature fired. Ernie<br />
  felt himself suddenly stiffen into immobility.<br />
  &quot;It's stunned, sir,&quot; Ernie heard one creature say to the<br />
  other.<br />
  &quot;Good, load it onto the ship.&quot; The two creatures lifted Ernie,<br />
  who had become stiff as a board, and began carrying him, dog and<br />
  all, toward the ship.<br />
  In spite of himself, Ernie was impressed. These special<br />
  effects are fantastic, he thought. I wonder how they do that<br />
  Stunner business?<br />
  Suddenly, a costumed comic-book character appeared, complete<br />
  with flowing cape and a big, red `M' on his chest. He blocked the<br />
  aliens' path. &quot;Unhand that barbarian!&quot; the comic-book character<br />
  boomed.<br />
  The space creature looked at each other in confusion. &quot;Unhand?<br />
  What does that mean? Are we supposed to cut off his hands?&quot;<br />
  The comic-book character looked exasperated. &quot;Look, just put<br />
  him down, okay?&quot; he said, in a much more conversational tone.<br />
  &quot;Put him down? Put him down?&quot; One space creature looked at the<br />
  other. &quot;What do we do now, sir?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, I don't know&quot;, the other creature replied. &quot;Just<br />
  disintegrate him, I guess.&quot; They drew their weapons.<br />
  The comic-book character looked confused. &quot;Um..uh..&quot; The<br />
  creatures advanced menacingly.<br />
  Suddenly, the comic-book character shouted what seemed to<br />
  Ernie to be a very odd thing. &quot;JMP 08F1!&quot;<br />
  Instantly, the entire scene vanished. Ernie, still stiff and<br />
  board-like, found himself unsupported, and dropped three feet to<br />
  land with a thud on a carpeted floor. &quot;Hi guy!&quot; Ernie heard someone<br />
  say. &quot;Howya doin'?&quot;<br />
  Ernie attempted to moan, but discovered that he was still<br />
  quite securely frozen. &quot;Here, let me help you up,&quot; he heard the<br />
  same voice say. The room swung into view as he felt himself lifted<br />
  up and placed on his feet like a statue. He seemed to be in<br />
  someone's living room.<br />
  The owner of the voice came into view. It was the comic-book<br />
  character, who in the cold light of day appeared to be a pleasant,<br />
  although rather vacuous-looking fellow of indeterminate age. &quot;Allow<br />
  me to introduce myself,&quot; he said cheerfully. &quot;I'm Captain Memory!&quot;<br />
  He extended a hand. Ernie instinctively attempted to shake the<br />
  man's hand, but discovered he was still quite frozen. It occurred<br />
  to him that he was still carrying the silly little dog, which was<br />
  also frozen.<br />
  The man dropped his outstretched hand embarrassedly. &quot;Hey, I<br />
  forgot,&quot; he said cheerfully. &quot;You're still paralyzed! Hey, no<br />
  sweat! It'll wear off in a few minutes!&quot; The man seated himself on<br />
  a nearby sofa and began perusing a small book he had produced from<br />
  somewhere. Ernie, of course, continued to stand where he was,<br />
  immobilized.<br />
  This is a really weird game, Ernie thought. The special<br />
  effects are fantastic, but the story line is bizarre. Like, what am<br />
  I supposed to do now?<br />
  After about fifteen minutes, Ernie's little finger began to<br />
  twitch. The twitching slowly spread across his hand. Finally, with<br />
  great effort, Ernie was able to take a step towards the comic-book<br />
  character, who was still seated on the sofa, reading his book.<br />
  The comic-book character looked up. &quot;Ah, it's wearing off!&quot;<br />
  he said. &quot;Are you feeling okay?' <br />
  &quot;Ungph&quot;, said Ernie, discovering that the power of speech was<br />
  slowly returning to him.<br />
  Captain Memory took that to mean &quot;yes&quot;. &quot;Good, good,&quot; he<br />
  replied in a cheerful tone. <br />
  &quot;Wharf gumg om?&quot; Ernie got out with difficulty.<br />
  &quot;You're probably wondering what's going on.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Yarf!&quot;<br />
  Ernie felt something sharp digging into his side. It was the<br />
  little dog, trying to get away. Unfortunately, that arm had not<br />
  unfrozen yet. <br />
  Ernie's ability to speak seemed to have returned. &quot;All right,<br />
  so what IS going on?&quot;<br />
  &quot;I had to rescue you from those creatures,&quot;  Captain Memory<br />
  explained. &quot;They were taking you to be a Cyberslave in the mining<br />
  pits.&quot;<br />
  Ernie frowned. &quot;What's a Cyberslave?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory shook his head sadly. &quot;They were going to force<br />
  you to operate mining robots, like so many other poor fools before<br />
  you. Like you, they thought they were going to play a game. The<br />
  next thing they knew, they were forced into a life of virtual hard<br />
  labor, operating mining robots 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, until<br />
  finally their bodies shrivelled up and their brains burned out.&quot; He<br />
  sighed. &quot;I was too late for most of them, but at least I could save<br />
  the two of you!&quot;<br />
  Ernie shivered. Some of this was beginning to seem a  little<br />
  too real. &quot;Man, this is a really strange game!&quot; he said. &quot;I'm not<br />
  complaining, mind you! I mean, the special effects alone make it<br />
  worth the money!&quot; He looked around. He seemed to be in a huge<br />
  living room, all decorated in 1950's style. It all seemed very<br />
  solid and believable. Ernie couldn't help being impressed. &quot;I mean,<br />
  this is, like, SO realistic! It's just that I'm having a real hard<br />
  time following the story! Like, what is supposed to be happening in<br />
  this game, anyway?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory sighed. &quot;Look, I'm trying to explain this to<br />
  you. It's NOT a game, okay? That game business was just a ruse. It<br />
  was a trap to get you to come in and hook yourself up to their<br />
  Virtual Reality system. Once you're in, you can't get out! They<br />
  turn you into a Cyberslave, and make you work until your brain<br />
  burns up!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, right,&quot; Ernie caught himself. &quot;I get it. You're not<br />
  supposed to admit it's a game. You're supposed to pretend it's<br />
  real. Okay, I'll play along. So, what now?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory shook his head sadly. &quot;I can see this isn't<br />
  going to be easy.&quot; He thought a moment. &quot;Okay, if this is a game,<br />
  you should be able to quit any time you like, right?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Uh, yeah.&quot; This was beginning to make Ernie uneasy.<br />
  &quot;So, how do you quit?&quot; the Captain demanded. &quot;Where's the ESC<br />
  button, or BREAK or whatever? HOW do you get out?&quot;<br />
  Ernie suddenly realized that he hadn't been given any<br />
  information on what to do when he wanted to quit playing. &quot;Uh,<br />
  well, I can quit anytime I want,&quot; he said defensively.<br />
  &quot;Okay; try!&quot; Captain Memory demanded.<br />
  Ernie shuffled uncomfortably. &quot;Well, maybe I'm not ready to<br />
  quit yet!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Try it, just to see what happens!&quot; the Captain urged.<br />
  &quot;Well&quot;, Ernie considered. &quot;It looks like I got into the wrong<br />
  game here. I wanted to play GOOMBAH THE BARBARIAN. I mean, no<br />
  offense, this is a cool game and everything, but I really wanted to<br />
  play GOOMBAH!&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory looked upset. &quot;This really isn't a game!&quot;<br />
  Ernie sighed. &quot;I'll tell you what. I'll just give up on this<br />
  for today, and I'll try again a week from Thursday, okay? So, I'll<br />
  just be heading home now, okay?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Great!&quot; said the Captain enthusiastically. &quot;Just quit right<br />
  now, okay?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well, okay,&quot; Ernie agreed halfheartedly. He tried to think of<br />
  what to do. &quot;Hello!&quot; he called up into the air. &quot;Is anybody there?<br />
  I'd like to go now!&quot; Nothing happened. <br />
  Ernie's heart began to pound. &quot;Hey, c'mon! Isn't anybody<br />
  listening to me? I said `I wanna GO!'&quot; No response.<br />
  This was beginning to be more than Ernie felt he could deal<br />
  with.&quot;Look, I'm not asking for my money back, or anything. I'll,<br />
  you know, try again some other time. I just want to go home, okay?&quot;<br />
  No answer.<br />
  Now Ernie really DID want to go! He began to panic. &quot;Hey,<br />
  isn't anybody out there!? WAKE UP!! I don't wanna play anymore! I<br />
  wanna go home!&quot; He wailed, &quot;I WANT MY MOMMY!!&quot; Nothing!<br />
  &quot;All right, all right, calm down!&quot; Captain Memory tried to<br />
  soothe Ernie. &quot;We'll get you out of here! It's just going to<br />
  take...a little time!&quot;<br />
  Ernie's left arm unfroze convulsively, dumping the little dog<br />
  on the floor. It growled unpleasantly. &quot;Why can't you get me out of<br />
  here NOW?&quot; he demanded petulantly.<br />
  The Captain shrugged. &quot;Hey, I don't run this show! I was lucky<br />
  I could even get you away from those creatures! Getting out is<br />
  another story altogether!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, this is awful!&quot; Ernie wailed. He still wasn't entirely<br />
  sure whether this was a game or not, but whatever it was, he didn't<br />
  like it anymore!<br />
  &quot;Maybe you'd better sit down.&quot; Captain Memory moved over to<br />
  one side of the sofa. Ernie decided that sitting down was probably<br />
  a good idea, and did so. This was beginning to get altogether too<br />
  real. &quot;Anyway, it could be worse!&quot;<br />
  &quot;How?&quot; Ernie moaned.<br />
  &quot;You could be like that poor guy over there,&quot; the Captain<br />
  said, gesturing towards the dog.<br />
  &quot;I don't need your sympathy,&quot; the dog snapped.<br />
  Ernie started. &quot;A talking dog! This is unbelievable! What<br />
  next?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Yeah, yeah&quot;, the dog snarled. &quot;Believe me, you don't look so<br />
  hot in that ridiculous fur loincloth either! Goombah the Barbarian!<br />
  I'm sure!&quot;  The dog pulled a cigar out of some invisible pocket and<br />
  began to smoke it, holding it in his front paw in a very un-canine<br />
  manner.<br />
  Ernie was suddenly very conscious of his loincloth. He looked<br />
  at the dog. &quot;What..what...?&quot;<br />
  &quot;See what I mean?&quot; the Captain gestured towards the dog. &quot;In<br />
  Virtual Reality, you can be anybody, or anything! You're lucky you<br />
  came through as yourself! You could have wound up like him, as a<br />
  dog!&quot;<br />
  The dog made a wry expression. &quot;Yeah, right. Or like YOU!&quot; He<br />
  looked the Captain up and down. &quot;A super hero?&quot; he said<br />
  sarcastically.<br />
  Captain Memory seemed nonplussed. &quot;Well...what's wrong with<br />
  that?&quot;<br />
  &quot;I'm sure!&quot; the replied. &quot;Okay, what super powers have you<br />
  got?&quot;<br />
  The Captain seemed defensive. &quot;Well, I do have some powers!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Like what?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well...&quot; the Captain thought a moment. &quot;Like, I program in<br />
  Assembler, and he doesn't!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Wait a minute!&quot; Ernie was confused. &quot;WHO doesn't?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Why, the man behind all this, of course,&quot; the Captain<br />
  explained. &quot;The evil genius, Waldo Stadium!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, I get it!&quot; Ernie brightened. &quot;This really is a game,<br />
  right?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory sighed exasperatedly. &quot;Look, for the last time,<br />
  this is NOT a game. The evil genius, Waldo Stadium, has embarked on<br />
  a plan to take over the entire world's computing power. He's been<br />
  breaking into people's systems one at a time, taking control of<br />
  them, and linking them to his other systems to create a vast<br />
  network that grows more powerful all the time. When he takes over<br />
  a system, he establishes complete control over anything and anybody<br />
  that happens to be in it at the time. That's how you fell into his<br />
  clutches. He's taken over the Virtual Arcades; anyone who was<br />
  playing a Virtual Reality games there is now his Cyberslave!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, man!&quot; Ernie sank his head into his hands. This was just<br />
  too much to handle! Suddenly, a thought occurred to him. &quot;So, how<br />
  did we get here, anyway?&quot; He gestured to the room around them.<br />
  Captain Memory pulled himself up to his full height. &quot;I<br />
  brought you here!&quot; he said proudly. He turned to the dog. &quot;See, I<br />
  told you I had powers!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Great,&quot; said the dog sarcastically. &quot;So where are we,<br />
  anyway?&quot;<br />
  &quot;We're in Virtual Reality,&quot; the Captain explained. &quot;You know,<br />
  Cyberspace.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Wait a minute,&quot; Ernie was finding this all hard to follow.<br />
  &quot;If we're still in the computer, doesn't that mean that this guy<br />
  Waldo Supermarket has control over us?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Stadium&quot;, Captain Memory corrected.<br />
  &quot;Whatever,&quot; Ernie said exasperatedly. &quot;What about my question?<br />
  Who's in control here?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Ah, that the beauty of it,&quot; explained the Captain, warming to<br />
  his subject. &quot;He's been taking over systems so fast that he can't<br />
  keep track of them. He doesn't even know what he's got! Remember,<br />
  when he takes over a system, he gets EVERYTHING that was in it.<br />
  He's got games, spreadsheets, database files, and hundreds of<br />
  different Virtual Realities, all mixed together in no order! That's<br />
  what gives us our window of opportunity. We can hide out in areas<br />
  he doesn't even know he's got, until we figure out how to bring<br />
  this diabolical scheme to a halt!&quot;<br />
  Ernie thought about this. &quot;Okay, we're in Cyberspace.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Right.&quot;<br />
  &quot;But where in Cyberspace?&quot;<br />
  The Captain slumped. &quot;Well....I don't exactly know.&quot;<br />
  The dog snickered. &quot;Some super hero!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well, well, I was under a lot of pressure!&quot; The Captain said<br />
  defensively. &quot;Those creatures would have had you in another second!<br />
  So, I just picked a location at random and JUMPed to it!&quot;<br />
  &quot;You JUMPed to it?&quot; Ernie was confused. &quot;How do you do that?&quot;<br />
  &quot;That's the beauty of Assembler,&quot; the Captain answered<br />
  enthusiastically. &quot;You can do stuff like that! Now, with a high-<br />
  level language, you'd never be able to do stuff like that. You can<br />
  only do what the language says you can do. In Assembler, you can do<br />
  ANYTHING.&quot; Captain Memory chuckled. &quot;That's Waldo's weak point. He<br />
  refuses to learn Assembler. He insists you can do all this stuff in<br />
  C, or whatever language he using now. Well, we'll show...&quot;<br />
  Suddenly, the dog broke in. &quot;At RANDOM!?&quot; he barked. &quot;You<br />
  JUMPed at RANDOM?!!!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well...&quot; the Captain was taken aback.<br />
  &quot;You mean,&quot; the dog continued. &quot;We could have wound up in the<br />
  middle of a SPREADSHEET!!?&quot;<br />
  Ernie tried to imagine life in a spreadsheet. It didn't sound<br />
  too appealing.<br />
  &quot;It was a chance I had to take,&quot; Captain Memory explained<br />
  defensively.<br />
  &quot;Great,&quot; the dog snarled. &quot;You take chances with our lives!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Okay, okay,&quot; the Captain said placatingly. &quot;I've got a better<br />
  location.&quot; He rummaged furiously through the pockets in his<br />
  costume. &quot;I wrote it down; it's here somewhere.&quot; he continued<br />
  searching. &quot;Um, no, um AHA!&quot; He brandished a small slip of paper in<br />
  the air. &quot;Here it is!&quot; He read the paper aloud. &quot;It's: INSPECTED BY<br />
  NO. 42!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Some super hero!&quot; the dog repeated.<br />
  The Captain frowned. &quot;Well, maybe that's not the right one!&quot;<br />
  He continued to rummage through his pockets. &quot;I'm sure I had it<br />
  here somewhere!&quot;<br />
  Ernie looked askance at the comic-book character. &quot;You don't<br />
  REMEMBER it?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory fidgeted uncomfortably. &quot;Hey, it's not easy to<br />
  remember a long string of numbers in Hex, you know! I'm doing the<br />
  best I can!&quot;<br />
  Ernie moaned quietly. This was all giving him a terrible<br />
  headache. Suddenly a thought occurred to him. &quot;Hey, this is all<br />
  really just a game, right?<br />
  Captain Memory looked annoyed. &quot;No, it is not a game. It never<br />
  was a game. Will you PLEASE stop saying that!&quot;<br />
  Ernie moaned quietly. Captain Memory glanced at his wrist.<br />
  &quot;We'd better hurry. We're running out of time.&quot;<br />
  Ernie looked up. &quot;You don't have a watch,&quot; he said<br />
  suspiciously. <br />
  Captain Memory continued to look at his bare wrist. &quot;Well,<br />
  no,&quot; he said, a bit crestfallen. &quot;I always wanted one, though.&quot;<br />
  Ernie looked around. &quot;Can't we just stay here? It's nice<br />
  here.&quot; They seemed to be in a very large living room of a well-kept<br />
  home. It appeared to be furnished in Fabulous Fifties style, except<br />
  for a few odd objects that Ernie couldn't identify.<br />
  &quot;We can't stay in one place to long,&quot; replied Captain Memory.<br />
  &quot;Waldo Stadium is sorting his data as fast as he can. If we stay in<br />
  one place too long, sooner or later he'll zero in on us. Anyway,&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory looked around. &quot;This place is beginning to look kind<br />
  of familiar to me. If I'm right, this isn't a safe place to be!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Okay, then where are we?&quot; the dog demanded.<br />
  &quot;I think we've landed in a game called `ATTACK OF THE GIANT<br />
  EGGPLANT.' If I'm right, this place is going to be nuked in&quot; he<br />
  glanced at his bare wrist again, &quot;oh, forty-five minutes or so.&quot;<br />
  Ernie began to be aware of a queasy feeling in the pit of his<br />
  stomach. This is making me anxious, he thought. I'm not going to do<br />
  things like this anymore. That's it, no more Virtual Reality for<br />
  me.<br />
  &quot;Maybe you'd like to watch some TV,&quot; Captain Memory suggested<br />
  cheerfully. &quot;Maybe that would make you feel better.&quot;<br />
  &quot;I thought we were in a hurry,&quot; Ernie answered.<br />
  &quot;We can watch for a couple minutes,&quot; the Captain replied.<br />
  I guess that makes as much sense as anything else, Ernie<br />
  thought, and followed the Captain towards the other end of the<br />
  room, where he noticed a television with a ten-foot-wide screen<br />
  playing with the sound turned off.<br />
  As they approached the television Ernie noticed a large, high-<br />
  backed '50's-style sofa positioned close in front of the TV. As<br />
  they came around the side of the sofa Ernie was startled to see two<br />
  people sitting there, staring intently at the television screen.<br />
  &quot;Hey!&quot; Ernie uttered involuntarily.<br />
  The two people seemed oblivious to Ernie's presence. &quot;Um,<br />
  hello?&quot; Ernie said tentatively. &quot;Excuse me?&quot; The people did not<br />
  respond.<br />
  Captain Memory sighed. &quot;It's too late for them, I'm afraid.&quot;<br />
  Ernie moaned. &quot;I wished you'd stop saying depressing things.<br />
  It makes my stomach hurt.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, sorry.&quot; Captain Memory seemed concerned. &quot;Um, how about<br />
  `It's too late for them, I'm pleased to say?'&quot;<br />
  &quot;That's not much better.&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory shrugged. &quot;Hey, I tried.&quot; He fell silent.<br />
  Ernie looked at the people. They seemed frozen into position,<br />
  staring at the television. They seemed emaciated; their muscles<br />
  seemed to have withered in the positions they were in. &quot;Okay, so<br />
  what's wrong with them?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory shook his head. &quot;They've been in Cyberspace too<br />
  long,&quot; he said sadly. &quot;There's a limit to how much of this you can<br />
  take, you know. Your brain burns out. I don't think these two have<br />
  much longer. All they can do is sit here in front of the TV.&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory sighed. &quot;Terrible, just terrible. Look at them; they<br />
  can't even change channels anymore.&quot;<br />
  Ernie shuddered. This is gruesome, he thought. I think it's<br />
  bad for me to look at gruesome things.<br />
  &quot;Oh well,&quot; Captain Memory brightened. &quot;Can't be helped.&quot; The<br />
  Captain unceremoniously pushed the stricken couple off the sofa.<br />
  They fell stiffly to the floor, motionless except for their eyes,<br />
  which rotated to stay fixed on the television screen. Captain<br />
  Memory seated himself as comfortably as possible on the sofa. &quot;So,<br />
  what do you want to watch?&quot;<br />
  They heard a voice behind them. &quot;Crap!&quot; The dog was looking<br />
  ruefully at his half-burned cigar and cursing quietly.<br />
  &quot;What's the matter?&quot; Captain Memory inquired cheerfully.<br />
  &quot;I'm almost out of cigars,&quot; the dog groused. &quot;Here I am stuck<br />
  in this stupid pointless computer game, and I can't even get a<br />
  decent cigar.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well, maybe we can get you some more, uh, what was your name<br />
  again?&quot; The Captain inquired.<br />
  &quot;Sterno.&quot; The dog intoned pompously.<br />
  &quot;Sterno?&quot; said Ernie dubiously. &quot;What kind of a name is that?<br />
  Sterno is those little cans of heating stuff.&quot;<br />
  &quot;I'll have you know that I am Lord High Keeper of the Sacred<br />
  Flame. Why, in better days....&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, I remember now!&quot; the Captain broke in brightly. &quot;That's<br />
  a game called `DOG STAR'! You must have been playing it when Waldo<br />
  took over your system! That's why you're trapped in the body of a<br />
  dog!&quot;<br />
  Sterno was taken aback. &quot;Uh, well, yeah, I was...&quot;<br />
  &quot;Lord High Keeper of the Sacred Flame, huh?&quot; the Captain<br />
  continued. &quot;You were doing pretty good!&quot;<br />
  Sterno brightened. &quot;Well, yes, as a matter of fact...&quot;<br />
  &quot;Wanna watch `Stump the Stars'?&quot; Captain Memory said to Ernie,<br />
  cutting off Sterno's tales of past glory.<br />
  &quot;What's that about?&quot; inquired Ernie.<br />
  &quot;It's this game show where famous Hollywood celebrities have<br />
  to answer these questions, and if they get them wrong, they get<br />
  their arms and legs chopped off. Stumps, get it?&quot; Captain Memory<br />
  laughed.<br />
  Ernie frowned. &quot;I don't like these new game shows.&quot; He glanced<br />
  at the television. The program seemed to be a game show. The MC was<br />
  an unpleasant looking man wearing a black military uniform with<br />
  skulls on the collar. He wore a monocle in his left eye, and<br />
  carried a riding crop, which he periodically cracked against his<br />
  jackboots.<br />
  &quot;Oh, it's one of those sadistic Nazi game show hosts,&quot; said<br />
  Ernie. &quot;Isn't there anything else on?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory was paging through a copy of TV Guide. &quot;Doesn't<br />
  look like there's anything on except game shows. How about `Vomit<br />
  for Dollars'?&quot;<br />
  Ernie grimaced.<br />
  &quot;Here's a movie,&quot; the Captain continued. &quot;How about `The<br />
  Humpback of Notre Dame', starring Ronald Reagan? You know, the one<br />
  about the whale that plays football?&quot;<br />
  Ernie sighed. &quot;What's this we're watching now?&quot;<br />
  &quot;I don't know.&quot; Captain Memory reached for a dial. &quot;Let's turn<br />
  up the volume and find out.&quot;<br />
  The off-camera announcer's voice came blasting out off the<br />
  set, painfully loud. &quot;... time for Wheel of Torture! The show which<br />
  every week asks the question: How much can you take?&quot;<br />
  The sound of applause welled up from the audience.<br />
  &quot;And here's our host,&quot; the announcer continued. &quot;The Gestapo's<br />
  greatest, that famous fiend, Sturmbannfuhrer Dr. Heinz von <br />
  Liederkranz!&quot;<br />
  Once again the sound of applause welled up. The sound seemed<br />
  to be growing impossibly loud. In fact, it seemed to be coming from<br />
  all around them. </p>
<p> The game show host smiled and bowed to the audience. &quot;Tank<br />
  you, tank you!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Now, let's drag in today's first victim!&quot; The announcer<br />
  continued. &quot;From  Palo Alto, California, let's have a big <br />
  round of applause for: CAPTAIN MEMORY!&quot;<br />
  The huge waves of applause filled Ernie's head, blocking out<br />
  everything else. He clenched his eyes tightly, trying to regain his<br />
  composure. He opened them again, and staggered back in shock. They<br />
  were no longer in the suburban living room. They were actually<br />
  standing on the stage that they had been watching only seconds<br />
  before. They had actually been sucked INTO the game show!<br />
  Captain Memory seemed confused. &quot;Hey, uh, wait a minute. I<br />
  didn't...&quot;<br />
  The announcer continued. &quot;And here's contestant number two!<br />
  From the Land  that Time Forgets, let's have a big hand for:<br />
  Goombah the Barbarian!&quot;<br />
  Ernie realized that they meant him. A Nazi SS trooper grabbed<br />
  him, and shoved him roughly forward.    &quot;Hey, lemme go...ow. Look.<br />
  I'm not supposed...&quot;<br />
  &quot;Say, I just LOVE your loincloth!&quot;, the announcer quipped.<br />
  Ernie could hear the audience laughing. He began to feel<br />
  terribly self-conscious.<br />
  &quot;And what a CUTE little dog!&quot; the announcer went on.<br />
  Sterno didn't seem to be particularly bothered by the state of<br />
  affairs. &quot;Say, you got a cigar?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Why SURE!&quot; The announcer handed him one. The audience<br />
  chuckled.<br />
  The announcer continued. &quot;Well, all RIGHT then! Dr. von<br />
  Liederkranz, what are we going to start out with today?&quot;<br />
  The Nazi smiled theatrically. &quot;Vell, Biff, I tought I'd shtart<br />
  out vit a liddle infention of mein own: de Hot Vhirling Corshcrew!&quot;<br />
  He pulled out a fiendish-looking device, made of glowing, whirling<br />
  metal parts. Without warning, he jabbed Captain Memory with it. The<br />
  Captain let out a blood-curdling shriek.<br />
  The audience applauded wildly.<br />
  &quot;VERY good!&quot; The announcer exclaimed jovially. &quot;Now, let's see<br />
  how that rated on our applause meter. A 57! Well, that's...&quot;<br />
  &quot;Forget this!&quot; shouted Captain Memory. &quot;JMP 08F1!&quot;<br />
  Suddenly, Ernie found himself back on the porcelain sofa. The<br />
  TV was now off. Ernie was trembling. &quot;Wha...what happened?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory was rubbing his side ruefully. &quot;Oh, I JUMPed us<br />
  back here. I really didn't like that Hot Whirling Corkscrew!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Good cigar, though.&quot; Sterno added, puffing away. The cigar<br />
  seemed to have improved his disposition somewhat.<br />
  &quot;I...I don't understand,&quot; Ernie whined.<br />
  &quot;You know how in a lot of computer games there's these little<br />
  doors or windows or something, and when you step through them<br />
  you're on a whole different level?&quot; Captain Memory asked.<br />
  &quot;Yeah?&quot; Ernie replied tentatively.<br />
  &quot;Well,&quot; the Captain gestured towards the TV. &quot;That's one of<br />
  them!&quot;<br />
  Ernie noticed an odd smell. He glanced towards the floor. The<br />
  two shrivelled people were...vibrating. Wisps of smoke seemed to be<br />
  coming out of their ears.<br />
  &quot;Oh, I forgot,&quot; said the Captain. &quot;You're never supposed to<br />
  turn the TV off on these people. Something bad happens... I forget<br />
  exactly what, but it's real bad.&quot;<br />
  Ernie continued to watch the couple in horror. The smoke was<br />
  coming more heavily new. Their foreheads seemed to be bulging.<br />
  &quot;What...what are we gonna do?&quot; Ernie choked out.<br />
  Captain Memory regarded his bare wrist carefully. &quot;Some day<br />
  I'm gonna get a watch,&quot; he said thoughtfully.<br />
  &quot;I really think we ought to do something,&quot; said Ernie<br />
  anxiously. Smoke was coming out of their noses now. Light seemed to<br />
  be appearing behind their eyes.<br />
  &quot;A silver watch might be nice. Do you think silver would look<br />
  good with this outfit?&quot; Captain Memory wondered.<br />
  &quot;I really, REALLY think we ought to do something!&quot; said Ernie<br />
  urgently. The TV addicts bodies were beginning to swell rapidly.<br />
  Ernie inched away from them.<br />
  &quot;Oh well,&quot; said Captain Memory unhurriedly. &quot;I guess it's<br />
  time to go. Uh, let's see.&quot; He thought a moment. &quot;Let's try: PUSH<br />
  FF0C.&quot; With that, they were gone.<br />
  Ernie blinked and staggered. The scene had changed completely. <br />
  Now he saw an elaborate 18th century drawing room around him. The<br />
  walls were decorated with filigreed mirrors and candelabras.<br />
  Delicate furniture surrounded them. It all looked very expensive. <br />
  Captain Memory looked about, obviously pleased with<br />
  himself. &quot;Hey, it worked!&quot;<br />
  Ernie's head swam. He felt confused and disoriented. These<br />
  abrupt changes of scene were making him sick. He sagged into a<br />
  chair. &quot;I don't feel very good,&quot; he complained.<br />
  Sterno puffed his cigar. &quot;This is almost decent,&quot; he mused.<br />
  &quot;You don't suppose there's a snifter of brandy about, do you?&quot; The<br />
  sound of a harpsichord drifted in from somewhere. &quot;Ah, Telemann,&quot;<br />
  Sterno commented. &quot;Very tasteful.&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory turned to Ernie. &quot;Gee, I'm sorry you're not<br />
  feeling well,&quot; he commiserated. &quot;Would it make you feel better to<br />
  watch some TV?&quot;<br />
  Ernie sat bolt upright. &quot;NO!&quot;<br />
  The Captain had brought along his copy of TV Guide. &quot;You're<br />
  missing the `Ozzie and Hitler Show'.&quot;<br />
  &quot;I don't care.&quot;<br />
  &quot;This is a good episode: `Ozzie forgets that the boss is<br />
  coming for dinner, so Hitler has to invade Poland on a moment's<br />
  notice.'&quot; Captain Memory chuckled.<br />
  &quot;I don't like these TV programs,&quot; grumbled Ernie.<br />
  &quot;Well, you know,&quot; said Captain Memory conversationally. &quot;If<br />
  you're going to travel to other Realities, you're not always going<br />
  to be able to get your favorite TV shows.&quot;<br />
  &quot;I want to go home,&quot; Ernie sulked. Suddenly a thought occurred<br />
  to him. He brightened. &quot;Hey, this is really just a game, right?&quot;<br />
  Sterno glared at him. &quot;This `game' business is getting really<br />
  old. Knock it off, okay?&quot;<br />
  Ernie had begun methodically feeling the furniture. He<br />
  reasoned that if it were a Virtual Reality illusion, he would be<br />
  able to see it, but since it had no substance, he wouldn't be able<br />
  to feel it. If my hand goes right through this stuff, he figured,<br />
  I'll know it's just an illusion. Unfortunately, everything was<br />
  proving to be distressingly solid.<br />
  &quot;You know, you look really stupid in that fur loincloth,&quot;<br />
  Sterno commented. &quot;And what in the world are you going to do with<br />
  that ridiculous plastic broadsword?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well, I hadda put a deposit on it,&quot; said Ernie defensively.<br />
  &quot;If I don't bring it back I lose 40 bucks.&quot; <br />
  Sterno shook his head. He turned to Captain Memory. &quot;Do we<br />
  really have to drag this kid around with us?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory shook his head sadly. &quot;I'm afraid so.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Why?&quot; Sterno demanded.<br />
  &quot;Well, you know&quot;, the Captain said off-handedly. &quot;We can't<br />
  just leave him to be a Cyberslave. It wouldn't be, you know, nice.&quot;<br />
  A thought occurred to Ernie. &quot;So, what are we supposed to do<br />
  about all of this, anyway?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Hmm?&quot; Captain Memory, still perusing the TV Guide, was not<br />
  paying very much attention.<br />
  &quot;Like, are we just going to keep bopping around Cyberspace or<br />
  what? I mean, do you have a Plan, or something?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory pulled himself up. &quot;Of course I have a Plan!&quot;<br />
  He turned to Sterno. &quot;See? I have Powers, and I have a Plan!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Okay, okay,&quot; Sterno agreed wearily. &quot;You're a fine super<br />
  hero! So, what's the plan?&quot;<br />
  &quot;We have to find a way to terminate this reality within the<br />
  confines of it's own logic,&quot; the Captain explained.<br />
  &quot;Huh?&quot; Ernie didn't follow this.<br />
  &quot;We have to end the game,&quot; the Captain rephrased. &quot;We have to<br />
  carry it through to it's logical conclusion, so that it terminates,<br />
  and shuts down.&quot;<br />
  Ernie frowned. &quot;What's the point of this game, anyway?&quot;<br />
  &quot;That's a problem,&quot; the Captain admitted. &quot;This isn't a game.<br />
  It's dozens, maybe hundreds of games, all stuck together in no<br />
  order. The &quot;point&quot; of what we're in now could be the point of any<br />
  of the games, or all of them, or none of them. There's no way to<br />
  tell. Luckily, we don't have to win the game, we just have to end<br />
  it. Any ending that's logically consistent will do.&quot;<br />
  Sterno frowned. &quot;Why do you have to end it within it's own<br />
  logic system? Couldn't you just crash it?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory sighed. &quot;I could crash the system, but it<br />
  wouldn't be a good idea!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Why not?&quot; Sterno demanded. &quot;Why can't you just insert some<br />
  totally impossible instruction and crash out the whole system? Then<br />
  this whole thing would be over and we could get out of here!&quot;<br />
  &quot;That's true,&quot; the Captain admitted. &quot;but you'd get some bad,<br />
  um, side effects.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Like what?&quot; Sterno wanted to know.<br />
  &quot;You see,&quot;  Captain Memory explained. &quot;After you've been in<br />
  Cyberspace for a while, you brain gets synchronized with it, and<br />
  your system becomes adapted to it. If it suddenly crashes, it<br />
  causes a tremendous shock to your system.&quot;<br />
  &quot;What, you mean we're going through all this just to avoid an<br />
  upset stomach or something?&quot; Sterno asked sarcastically. &quot;After<br />
  all, how bad could it be?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well, um,&quot; the Captain looked very uncomfortable. &quot;It's not<br />
  just an upset stomach....&quot;<br />
  &quot;Okay,&quot; Sterno demanded. &quot;Then what DOES it cause?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Um, generally, cardiac arrest,&quot; the Captain answered<br />
  reluctantly.<br />
  Sterno was shocked. &quot;You mean, if you crash the system it'll<br />
  KILL us?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Afraid so,&quot; the Captain nodded sadly. &quot;Along with anybody<br />
  else who's hooked into the system at the time.&quot;<br />
  Ernie began to worry. &quot;What about ending the game, then? Won't<br />
  that kill us, too? Does that mean we're trapped here forever!?&quot; He<br />
  began to panic.<br />
  &quot;No, no, calm down,&quot; said the Captain reassuringly. &quot;if we end<br />
  the game within the confines of it's own logic, it'll shut down in<br />
  an orderly manner, giving your systems time to readjust before<br />
  you're returned to reality.It won't be a shock to your systems, and<br />
  your hearts won't stop. It's only if it suddenly, abruptly, stops,<br />
  like when the system crashes, that...&quot;<br />
  &quot;Okay, okay, we get the picture,&quot; Sterno broke it. &quot;Don't<br />
  crash the system!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Okay.&quot; Captain Memory returned to the TV Guide.<br />
  Ernie sighed. It was bad enough being trapped in a computer<br />
  game. Now his life was in danger as well. And his only hope seems<br />
  to be this costumed clown who thinks he's a super hero. Wasn't this<br />
  ever going to stop getting worse?<br />
  Suddenly, Captain Memory started. &quot;Oh NO,&quot; he wailed. &quot;Not<br />
  THAT!&quot;<br />
  &quot;What happened? What happened?!&quot; cried Ernie, panic-stricken.<br />
  What could possibly have happened that was worse than the<br />
  predicament they were already in?<br />
  Captain Memory was still holding the TV Guide. &quot;We missed<br />
  Gilligan's Island!&quot;<br />
  Ernie cradled his head in his hands. &quot;I can't stand it. I just<br />
  can't stand it.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Chapter 2<br />
</p>
<p> Ernie was beginning to feel a little bit better. After all,<br />
  nothing really weird had happened for about, oh, twenty minutes or<br />
  so. Things were, relatively speaking, pretty quiet.<br />
  Ernie examined his surroundings. &quot;What is this place?&quot;<br />
  &quot;It's a spaceship,&quot; said Captain Memory conversationally.<br />
  Ernie was skeptical. &quot;It doesn't LOOK like a spaceship.&quot;<br />
  Sterno sniffed. &quot;They don't have to always be those ghastly<br />
  chrome-and-glass space things. Utterly tasteless. This place,&quot;<br />
  Sterno looked about approvingly. &quot;Is actually not bad.&quot;<br />
  Ernie was unconvinced. &quot;It's not moving.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Sure it is,&quot; the Captain returned. &quot;You just can't feel it.<br />
  Wanna look out?&quot; Captain Memory stood up, and walked over to what<br />
  appeared to be a small harpsichord. He regarded the keys. &quot;Let's<br />
  see. Um, C Major?&quot; He hit the appropriate keys. With a deep<br />
  rumbling sound, the ceiling slid back, revealing a view of deep<br />
  space. &quot;Ah!&quot; Captain Memory was pleased. He returned to the sofa.<br />
  Ernie regarded the view with amazement. Stars and galaxies<br />
  burned brightly against the blackness of space. They seemed to be<br />
  an incredible distance from Earth. Ernie turned to Captain Memory.<br />
  &quot;Where ARE we?&quot;<br />
  The Captain shrugged. &quot;Space.&quot;<br />
  &quot;But where in space?&quot; Ernie wanted to know. &quot;Are we far from<br />
  Earth?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory concentrated. &quot;Let's see, um, `Long, long, ago<br />
  in a galaxy far, far...&quot; Ernie frowned. The Captain stopped. &quot;Wait,<br />
  that's not right.&quot; He furrowed his brow. &quot;Well, I can't exactly<br />
  recall where we are, but it doesn't really matter.&quot; Captain Memory<br />
  was absorbed in looking at the vista of deep space. &quot;After all,<br />
  when you wish upon a star, it makes no difference where you are.&quot;<br />
  Ernie frowned. &quot;Something about that bugs me.&quot;<br />
  &quot;It doesn't sound quite cricket,&quot; agreed Sterno.<br />
  &quot;Well, by jiminy,&quot; exclaimed the Captain. &quot;We'll just have to<br />
  move on to something else. Wanna watch some TV?&quot;<br />
  &quot;I'd rather not,&quot; said Ernie.<br />
  &quot;Aww.&quot; Captain Memory was disappointed.<br />
  Ernie looked around. &quot;Are we safe here?&quot;<br />
  &quot;For the moment,&quot; the Captain shrugged. &quot;As I said, we can't<br />
  stay anywhere too long. Waldo will zero in on us if we do.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Then what?&quot; Ernie wanted to know.<br />
  &quot;I dunno,&quot; the Captain mused. &quot;I suppose he'll come after us.&quot;<br />
  Ernie frowned. &quot;You mean he'll come in himself, like<br />
  personally?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory thought about that. &quot;Well, I don't suppose<br />
  he'll come in AS himself. After all, you can be anyone, or<br />
  anyTHING, in Cyperspace. He'll come in the form of someone else,<br />
  some famous person, or someone he'd like to be...&quot;<br />
  &quot;Like you and your super-hero outfit,&quot; Sterno broke in.<br />
  &quot;Well...yeah,&quot; the Captain admitted.<br />
  Ernie gave than some thought. &quot;So, what form would an evil<br />
  genius want to take?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory shrugged. &quot;I dunno. A Nazi, maybe...&quot; He<br />
  returned to the TV Guide.<br />
  &quot;This is much like my own Virtual Reality,&quot; mused Sterno. He<br />
  seemed to have found a snifter of brandy somewhere, which he<br />
  swirled pensively in his left paw. &quot;I had a drawing room like this.<br />
  I wrote poetry there. Immortal odes to the glory of the canine<br />
  race.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Really.&quot; Captain Memory was not really paying attention.<br />
  &quot;In fact, I happen to have some with me. Perhaps you'd like to<br />
  see it?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Mmm.&quot; Captain Memory was gazing at the view. Sterno took his<br />
  answer to be a `yes', and handed him a piece of paper with some<br />
  verses on it. <br />
  Captain Memory barely glanced at it. &quot;Looks like doggerel to<br />
  me,&quot; he said uncaringly.<br />
  Sterno's mood turned black. &quot;I suppose you think that's<br />
  funny,&quot; he snarled. &quot;I open my heart to you, and you mock me. Well,<br />
  we'll see who has the last laugh! I know when I'm right! I'm right,<br />
  and you're wrong, and that's all there is to it.&quot;<br />
  Ernie thought a moment. &quot;Sounds to me like you're being a bit<br />
  dogmatic to me.&quot;<br />
  &quot;You fool!&quot; Sterno barked. &quot;You don't even have the vaguest<br />
  idea what's going on here! You're a fine one to talk!&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory abruptly changed the subject. &quot;Wanna watch some<br />
  TV?&quot; <br />
  Ernie really didn't want to watch any TV, but he was feeling<br />
  very uncomfortable with the current drift of the conversation.<br />
  Maybe watching TV would be a good way to change the subject.<br />
  &quot;Uh, this isn't gonna be like last time, is it? We're not<br />
  going to get sucked into the TV show again, are we?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Naw,&quot; the Captain assured him. &quot;That was a fluke. One-in-a-<br />
  million chance. It'll never happen again.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well, okay then,&quot; Ernie agreed reluctantly.<br />
  Captain Memory returned to the harpsichord. &quot;Um, F-sharp?&quot; He<br />
  hit the appropriate keys. The ceiling view-screen suddenly changed<br />
  from a view of space to a television picture. They seemed to have<br />
  tuned in to a commercial.<br />
  The announcer was an dour looking man wearing a brown military<br />
  uniform and jackboots. He seemed to be making a strenuous effort to<br />
  be cheerful.<br />
  &quot;Hi, I'm Martin Bohrmann,&quot; the announcer held up two record<br />
  albums. &quot;And if you remember me, you remember HITLER'S GREATEST<br />
  HITS!&quot;<br />
  &quot;I don't remember that,&quot; said Ernie to no-one in particular.<br />
  &quot;Now, together at last on these two long-playing record<br />
  albums, 50 all-time golden hits from the Third Reich! You get the<br />
  Gestapo Glee Club with HEIL HITLER, DEAR!&quot; Military-sounding music<br />
  started up in the background.<br />
  &quot;Do we have to watch this?&quot; Ernie complained.<br />
  &quot;...you can't buy these records in any store, but if you call<br />
  this number, a secret messenger will knock on your door in the<br />
  middle of the night and...&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, okay, I'll change it.&quot; Captain Memory struck a key on the<br />
  harpsichord. The screen changed to black-and-white. Characters in<br />
  1950's clothing appeared.<br />
  &quot;It's an old movie,&quot; Ernie commented. He felt better. An old<br />
  movie; that would be safe, right? Nothing bad could happen out of<br />
  an old movie, right?<br />
  A man in a suit with a cloth over his head appeared on the<br />
  screen. A pretty young woman came up to him, and suddenly yanked<br />
  the cloth away. Under the cloth, the man had the tremendously<br />
  enlarged head of a fly, complete with huge, multifaceted eyes,<br />
  antennae, and a long black snout. The young woman began to scream.<br />
  &quot;Hey, I remember this!&quot; said Ernie brightly. It's THE FLY -<br />
  the original version, too. You know, that movie about the scientist<br />
  who goes into a matter transmitter, except a fly gets in it, and he<br />
  winds up with the head of a fly? Hey, this is a great movie!&quot; Ernie<br />
  settled back to watch, pleased that he could finally watch<br />
  something he understood.<br />
  The movie cut to a commercial. &quot;Hi, I'm Martin Bohrmann, and<br />
  if you remember me...&quot;<br />
  Ernie moaned. I wish they wouldn't keep running the same<br />
  commercial, he thought.<br />
  The commercial ended. &quot;And now, back to THE DATING GAME!&quot;<br />
  &quot;THE DATING GAME!&quot; Ernie sat bolt upright. &quot;I don't wanna<br />
  watch the Dating Game! What happened to my movie?!&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory looked up. &quot;Oh, a game show!&quot; he said brightly.<br />
  He hadn't been paying much attention up to this point. &quot;I like game<br />
  shows! You know, you can really get into game shows!&quot;<br />
  &quot;I KNOW,&quot; Ernie interrupted. &quot;That's what I'm AFRAID of!&quot;<br />
  The man on the screen looked like a typical game show host,<br />
  wearing a plaid polyester suit with a large carnation in his lapel.<br />
  The only thing that seemed a bit odd about him is that he was<br />
  wearing jackboots and a monocle.<br />
  &quot;Congratulations!&quot; he was saying to an excited female<br />
  contestant. &quot;You'fe von an all-expenses-paid dream date vit<br />
  bachelor number 3!&quot; The game show host seemed to have a bit of a<br />
  German accent.<br />
  &quot;Oh, I just can't wait to see him!&quot; The young woman was<br />
  jumping up and down with excitement. <br />
  &quot;Bachelor number three, come on out!&quot; The game show host<br />
  called out. A door opened, and out stepped a man, wearing a suit,<br />
  who had the enormously enlarged head of a fly. The young woman<br />
  began to scream.<br />
  Ernie looked confused. &quot;Hey, what are we watching, anyway? Is<br />
  this THE FLY, or THE DATING GAME, or what?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory was looking at the TV Guide upside-down. &quot;Mmm<br />
  hmm,&quot; he agreed, not paying much attention.<br />
  The host seemed to be wrapping the show up. &quot;Vell folks, dis<br />
  is Biff Mozzarella, saying...&quot;<br />
  &quot;Wait a minute&quot; Sterno interrupted. &quot;I think something smells<br />
  around here!<br />
  Captain Memory looked up. &quot;Got a problem?&quot; he asked<br />
  unconcernedly.<br />
  &quot;Think about it,&quot; Sterno considered. &quot;His name: Mozzarella.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Huh?&quot; said Ernie. &quot;You mean, Biff?&quot;<br />
  &quot;This guy's name is Mozzarella,&quot; Sterno noted. &quot;The last guys<br />
  name was Liederkranz.&quot;<br />
  &quot;So?&quot; asked Ernie uncomprehendingly.<br />
  &quot;Cheese, get it?&quot; cried Sterno. &quot;They're both cheese!&quot; <br />
  I don't think I like the sound of this, Ernie thought. &quot;Um,<br />
  well, you know,&quot; he began to Captain Memory. &quot;Maybe we ought to<br />
  give this some consideration...&quot;<br />
  But it was too late. With a deafening roar, the delicate panel<br />
  doors to the room were blown off their hinges. A dozen armed men<br />
  rushed in, pointing wicked-looking weapons at the trio. &quot;FREEZE!&quot;<br />
  one of them shouted.<br />
  Captain Memory looked uncomprehending. &quot;It seems a bit warm<br />
  for that,&quot; he commented.<br />
  The group of armed men parted to make way for an unpleasant<br />
  looking man wearing a black military uniform, jackboots, and a<br />
  monocle. &quot;Zo, ve meet again!&quot;<br />
  The man, did, in fact, look somewhat familiar to Ernie.<br />
  &quot;Haven't I seen you somewhere before?&quot;<br />
  The man smiled warmly. &quot;No doubt you've seen my TV show. THE<br />
  TORTURE GAME is a big hit these days. I'm...&quot; He drew himself up to<br />
  his full height. &quot;Sturmbannfuhrer Dr. Heinz von Liederkranz, the<br />
  Gestapo's greatest.&quot; He paused; he seemed to be waiting for<br />
  applause. His men looked at each other quickly, and began clapping.<br />
  Ernie thought it might be a good idea if he applauded too.<br />
  &quot;ENOUGH!&quot; Von Liederkranz silenced his men with a quick sweep<br />
  of his riding crop, leaving Ernie applauding feebly all by himself.<br />
  Ernie looked around, and quickly stopped.<br />
  Von Liederkranz prodded Captain Memory in the chest with his<br />
  riding crop. &quot;Now! You will tell us your name, rank and serial<br />
  number!&quot;<br />
  &quot;My what?&quot; Captain Memory looked uncomprehending.<br />
  &quot;Your name, rank, and serial number!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Name, rank and cereal number?&quot; mused the Captain. &quot;But I<br />
  never even eat cereal.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Do not be coy with us!&quot; snapped the Sturmbannfuhrer. &quot;We know<br />
  you are one of Them! Ve know you are a spy on a mission of sabotage<br />
  and destruction!&quot; He paused calculatingly. &quot;Remember, ve have vays<br />
  of making you talk!&quot;<br />
  Ernie turned to Captain Memory in confusion. &quot;Who are these<br />
  guys, anyway?&quot;<br />
  &quot;They LOOK like a bunch of Nazis,&quot; the Captain replied<br />
  thoughtfully. &quot;But they COULD be...&quot;<br />
  &quot;Enough!&quot; von Liederkranz broke in. &quot;You vill answer our<br />
  questions!&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory concentrated. &quot;How about: Who Put the Bop in<br />
  the Bop-Shu-Bop-Shu-Bop?&quot; he suggested.<br />
  Von Liederkranz's tone abruptly changed. &quot;You know,&quot; he turned<br />
  to Captain Memory. &quot;Ve do not haff to be enemies. Ve could be<br />
  friends. You vould like to be friends, nein?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Sure.&quot; Captain Memory was nothing if not agreeable.<br />
  &quot;Then tell us vot ve vant to know!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Okay.&quot; The Captain thought a minute. &quot;The attack is set for<br />
  exactly 10:30. Julius Caesar will march on Omaha, and the<br />
  Enterprise will attack the Titanic somewhere in the South China<br />
  Sea. Then Patton will drive up through the south of France, make a<br />
  right onto Route 66, go down three stop lights, turn right and it's<br />
  the third house from the corner.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Just as ve thought!&quot; This, of course, was not what the<br />
  Sturmbannfuhrer had thought at all. However, he had to maintain a<br />
  good appearance in front of his men. He smiled amiably. &quot;Please go<br />
  on!&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory decided it was time to stop. &quot;I think I've said<br />
  too much already!&quot;<br />
  Von Liederkranz's face turned hard. &quot;You misunderstand,&quot; he<br />
  said menacingly. &quot;I'm not asking you, I'm TELLING YOU! TALK! NOW!!&quot;<br />
  &quot;I'd really rather not.&quot; Captain Memory didn't seem to be too<br />
  upset by the proceedings. Ernie, however, was beginning to sweat.<br />
  Sterno was glaring at the other two, giving them an I-told-you-so<br />
  look.<br />
  Von Liederkranz smiled sadistically. &quot;You can't escape, you<br />
  know. Ve haff total control of all computation in zis sector. Ze<br />
  system vill not accept commands from anyone but me. Dere is no vay<br />
  out. Ve have you vhere ve vant you!&quot; <br />
  &quot;Well,&quot; Captain Memory began. &quot;I'm afraid I don't have<br />
  time...&quot;<br />
  &quot;So be it!&quot; cried von Liederkranz. &quot;If dat's de vay you are<br />
  going to be - bring on de Hot Vhirling Corkscrew!&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory looked pained. &quot;You know, I really don't care<br />
  for the Hot Vhirling...I mean `Whirling' Corkscrew.&quot;<br />
  Von Liederkranz laughed sadistically. &quot;You are very funny. Ve<br />
  vill see how funny you vill be after a few hours vit mein<br />
  Corkscrew!&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory seemed offended. &quot;Well, if you're going to be<br />
  like that, I'm simply going to have to leave.&quot;<br />
  Von Liederkranz laughed sadistically, again. In fact, he<br />
  didn't seem to be able to laugh any other way. &quot;Dere is no way<br />
  out!&quot; von Liederkranz continued. &quot;You cannot break into ze system<br />
  from here!&quot;<br />
  Ernie noticed his stomach beginning to hurt again. Stress, he<br />
  thought. It's not good for me to be under this much stress. I think<br />
  it's affecting my health. Maybe I'm getting an ulcer?<br />
  Von Liederkranz switched on his Hot Whirling Corkscrew, which,<br />
  true to it's name began to whirl and glow. Laughing sadistically,<br />
  as usual, he began to bring it closer and closer to Captain<br />
  Memory's face.<br />
  The torture device edged ever nearer, inch by inch, spinning<br />
  and hissing as it approached Captain Memory's unprotected face.<br />
  Ernie shut his eyes tightly. It's too horrible, he thought. I can't<br />
  watch. He waited for the inevitable screams.<br />
  Captain Memory looked miffed. &quot;Okay, be like that! JMP 08F1!&quot;<br />
  Ernie opened his eyes. The rococo sitting room had vanished.<br />
  They seemed to be back in the huge Chicago living room that they<br />
  had originally found themselves in after leaving the Simulation<br />
  Arcade. Ernie's head swam. This is all changing too fast for me, he<br />
  thought. I just can't keep up with it. He found a chair and sat<br />
  down. Ernie didn't feel well at all. <br />
  Captain Memory was strolling around, ruefully inspecting the<br />
  surroundings. &quot;Look at this place,&quot; he lamented. &quot;What a mess!&quot;<br />
  Ernie looked about. The place, was, in fact, in dismal shape.<br />
  The walls were covered with soot, the furniture was singed. Much of<br />
  the furniture was knocked over; some was totally splintered. It<br />
  looked rather like a bomb had gone off in the room. Ernie recovered<br />
  enough composure to speak. &quot;Why...why are we back here?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, I apologize for that,&quot;  Captain Memory explained. &quot;I just<br />
  couldn't think of anyplace else on such short notice. I should have<br />
  known this place would be a mess.&quot;<br />
  Ernie looked around. &quot;Yeah, this place has really gone to the<br />
  dogs.&quot; <br />
  &quot;I suppose you think that's funny!&quot; Sterno growled. <br />
  Ernie noticed two piles of burned rags lying near the TV set.<br />
  They were still smoldering slightly. He shuddered. He would rather<br />
  not think about what might have happened here.<br />
  &quot;Well...well,&quot; Ernie started again. &quot;How did we get here? That<br />
  Nazi said we couldn't escape. He said they controlled all<br />
  computation in the sector!&quot;<br />
  &quot;That's right, Captain Memory smiled. &quot;We JUMPed to a<br />
  different sector!&quot;<br />
  Ernie decided to just accept that explanation, even though he<br />
  didn't entirely understand it.<br />
  &quot;Makes about as much sense as anything else,&quot; Sterno agreed.<br />
  He seemed to have found another cigar, and was puffing away on it<br />
  contentedly. He seemed to be in a much better mood whenever he had<br />
  a cigar. &quot;Pity you couldn't have transported that brandy along with<br />
  us, though.&quot;<br />
  Ernie was desperately trying to make sense of all of this.<br />
  &quot;So, who were those Nazi guys, anyway?&quot;<br />
  &quot;That's hard to say for sure,&quot; CM said thoughtfully. &quot;They're<br />
  probably Cyberslaves, just like you would have been if I hadn't<br />
  rescued you.&quot;<br />
  Ernie shuddered. He really didn't like the sound of that<br />
  `Cyberslave' stuff.&quot;<br />
  &quot;What about their leader, Von Liederkranz?&quot; Sterno wondered.<br />
  &quot;He didn't look a slave. In fact, he seemed to be having a really<br />
  good time!&quot;<br />
  The Captain nodded. &quot;I'm sure he's not a slave,&quot; he agreed.<br />
  &quot;He's one of the Slavemasters. In fact,&quot; Captain Memory furled his<br />
  brow in thought. &quot;He MIGHT even be Waldo Stadium himself!&quot;<br />
  &quot;So, what are we doing in all of this?&quot; Ernie wanted to know.<br />
  Sterno rolled his eyes upward. &quot;Hopeless!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Don't pick on the kid!&quot; Captain Memory defended Ernie.<br />
  &quot;Yeah!&quot; Ernie agreed.<br />
  &quot;After all,&quot; Captain Memory continued. &quot;It's not his fault<br />
  he's stupid!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Yeah, it's...&quot; Ernie broke off. That wasn't turning out the<br />
  way he'd hoped. <br />
  Sterno looked at the Captain. &quot;So, what kind of super hero are<br />
  you supposed to be, anyway?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Me?&quot; Captain Memory expounded. &quot;Why I'm a strange visitor<br />
  from another planet who came to Earth with powers and abilities far<br />
  beyond those of mortal men.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Powers and abilities?&quot; Ernie wanted to know. &quot;Like what?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory continued expansively. &quot;I'm faster than a<br />
  speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive; why, I can even<br />
  leap tall buildings in a single bound!&quot;<br />
  This was beginning to sound a bit familiar to Ernie. &quot;Anything<br />
  else?&quot;<br />
  &quot;I can also change the course of mighty rivers and bend steel<br />
  in my bare hands.&quot;<br />
  I've got it now, thought Ernie. &quot;You don't, by any chance,<br />
  tend to go around disguised as Clark Kent, mild-mannered reporter<br />
  for a great metropolitan newspaper, and fight a never-ending battle<br />
  for truth, justice, and the American way, do you?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory looked totally mystified. &quot;Why, no. Why would<br />
  I want to do a thing like that?&quot;<br />
  Ernie was nonplussed. &quot;Well...I dunno. I just sort of<br />
  thought...&quot; He trailed off.<br />
  There was an awkward silence. Sterno cleared his throat. &quot;You<br />
  don't suppose these people keep caviar about somewhere, do you?&quot;<br />
  Grateful for the interruption, Ernie began searching. He found<br />
  a small white cabinet that looked like it might be a refrigerator.<br />
  &quot;Ah!&quot; He pulled out a small jar. &quot;How's this?&quot;<br />
  Sterno examined the jar ruefully. &quot;Oh,&quot; he sniffed. &quot;American<br />
  caviar. Well, I suppose Beluga was a bit too much to ask. We'll<br />
  just have to rough it, I imagine.&quot; He looked around. &quot;You wouldn't<br />
  happen to have a slice of fresh onion, by any chance?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory had returned to perusing the TV Guide. &quot;Wanna<br />
  watch some TV?&quot; he asked brightly. &quot;It's almost time for that great<br />
  game show about the dinosaur age.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Which one is that?&quot; Ernie couldn't recall any shows about<br />
  dinosaurs.<br />
  &quot;Oh, I'm sure you've seen it. It's real famous!&quot; the Captain<br />
  explained. &quot;It's called YOU BET JURASSIC!&quot;<br />
  Ernie frowned. Something about that name did seem a bit<br />
  familiar. All these familiar-sounding things that he couldn't quite<br />
  place were making him very uneasy. <br />
  Suddenly, the television came on. &quot;Prepare to die, inferior<br />
  creatures!&quot; the speaker blared.<br />
  Ernie was annoyed. &quot;I thought we turned that off!&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory looked upset. &quot;Oh, dear. I forgot about that!&quot;<br />
  Ernie began to get that queasy feeling in his stomach again.<br />
  &quot;Forgot about WHAT?&quot;<br />
  The television screen showed a huge purple vegetable, lifting<br />
  itself up on a green stalk. It seemed to be gloating, insofar as a<br />
  vegetable can gloat. &quot;You will soon respire your last, animal<br />
  scum!&quot; the vegetable continued. &quot;No longer shall we of the<br />
  vegetable kingdom be your helpless victims, to be bred and<br />
  destroyed at your whims! The day of reckoning is here at last!<br />
  Prepare to receive the Vengeance of the Vegetables!&quot;<br />
  Ernie shifted his weight uncomfortably. &quot;This sure is a weird<br />
  program.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, it's not a program,&quot; Captain Memory explained. &quot;The<br />
  Killer Eggplants are about to attack!&quot;<br />
  Ernie thought he'd better sit down again. &quot;Huh?&quot;<br />
  &quot;I told you, we're in a game called `ATTACK OF THE KILLER<br />
  EGGPLANTS'!&quot; Captain Memory regarded his bare wrist. &quot;Oh dear, it's<br />
  been almost forty-five minutes.&quot;<br />
  Ernie didn't get it. &quot;I don't get it,&quot; he said.<br />
  &quot;Remember those nukes I told you about?&quot;<br />
  Ernie didn't like the sound of this. He tried to put the<br />
  pieces together. &quot;They're going to nuke us?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Afraid so,&quot; said Captain Memory cheerily. He didn't seem<br />
  particularly upset at the idea.<br />
  &quot;WHY?!&quot;<br />
  &quot;To put an end to the Revolt of the Vegetables,&quot; Captain<br />
  Memory explained. &quot;And fry the Great Eggplant once and for all!&quot;<br />
  Ernie was trying hard to understand all of this. &quot;let me get<br />
  this straight - you mean the vegetables have risen up in revolt?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Of course not!&quot; Captain Memory laughed. &quot;How could vegetables<br />
  possibly do a thing like that?&quot;<br />
  Ernie was getting frustrated. &quot;Then WHAT is GOING ON!?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory chuckled. &quot;Oh, it's all a big practical joke!&quot;<br />
  Ernie felt relieved. &quot;Then they're NOT going to nuke Chicago?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh no, they're really going to do it.&quot; Captain Memory seemed<br />
  to think this was all very funny. &quot;After all, they don't know it's<br />
  a joke, do they? It wouldn't be very funny if they KNEW it was a<br />
  joke, would it?&quot; Captain Memory chuckled. &quot;Nope, they're going to<br />
  bomb the whole city back to the Stone Age.&quot;<br />
  Ernie heard the sound of jets flying very close by outside. He<br />
  began to feel very uneasy. &quot;So, um, what are we going to do?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Do?&quot; asked Captain Memory innocently.<br />
  Ernie began to feel an intense heat radiating through the<br />
  walls. He clenched his eyes tightly closed. I'll just close my<br />
  eyes, he thought. Maybe when I open them again this will all be<br />
  gone.<br />
  He opened his eyes.<br />
  It was all gone.<br />
  Ernie was taken aback. Wow, he thought. It worked.<br />
  He looked around. They were in the midst of a grassy field,<br />
  studded with wildflowers. Bright sunshine bathed the scene. Captain<br />
  Memory was idly toying with blades of grass; Sterno was sniffing<br />
  the flowers.<br />
  &quot;Where are we?&quot; Ernie asked dumbly.<br />
  &quot;Why, the Stone Age, of course.&quot; Captain Memory seemed to<br />
  think this was quite obvious. &quot;Somewhere in the Jurassic period, I<br />
  think.&quot;<br />
  &quot;You knew this would happen?&quot; Ernie cried.<br />
  &quot;Sure,&quot; replied the Captain offhandedly. &quot;It's part of the<br />
  game!&quot;<br />
  Ernie sighed. A gentle breeze swayed the tall grass. He could<br />
  hear birdsongs in the distance. It all seemed very peaceful. Good,<br />
  thought Ernie. I could use a break. He lay down in the grass and<br />
  rested. At least, he thought, we won't have to watch any TV.<br />
  The sun moved slowly across the sky as the hours passed. After<br />
  a time, Ernie sat up. It occurred to him that he might be getting<br />
  a sunburn. &quot;So, what are we gonna do in the Stone Age?&quot; he asked. <br />
  &quot;Get stoned?&quot; Sterno offered.<br />
  Captain Memory looked at his bare wrist. &quot;I'm glad you<br />
  mentioned that,&quot; he said. &quot;It's time we were on our way.&quot;<br />
  I knew I shouldn't have said anything, Ernie thought. Oh well,<br />
  it's too late now. &quot;So now what?&quot;<br />
  &quot;We'd better find a cave before it gets dark, don't you<br />
  think?&quot; Captain Memory said cheerily. &quot;Wouldn't want to have a run-<br />
  in with one of those saber-tooth tigers, would we?&quot; <br />
  Ernie frowned. He had forgotten that there would be things<br />
  like saber-tooth tigers in the Stone Age, although he supposed he<br />
  should have realized that. It suddenly occurred to him that Stone<br />
  Age caves often held giant cave bears. &quot;Um, maybe we should think<br />
  about this,&quot; he called out to Captain Memory. The Captain, however,<br />
  was already far ahead of Ernie, striding purposefully towards a<br />
  ridge of white cliffs in the distance. He seemed not to hear Ernie,<br />
  or, if he did, he paid no attention. Ernie hurried to catch up.<br />
  &quot;At least you're properly dressed for the occasion,&quot; Sterno<br />
  commented to Ernie. &quot;I understand fur loincloths are all the rage<br />
  this year.&quot; Sterno snickered.<br />
  Ernie looked down at his garment. He had been wearing it so<br />
  long he had sort of forgotten about it.<br />
  &quot;If we run into any saber-tooth tigers,&quot; Sterno continued.<br />
  &quot;You can just chop them up with your plastic broadsword.&quot; Sterno<br />
  laughed unpleasantly.<br />
  &quot;Are you still carrying that thing?&quot; Captain Memory called,<br />
  without looking back.<br />
  &quot;Hey, it's a forty buck deposit, okay?&quot; Ernie sensed that they<br />
  were both laughing at him. &quot;Gimme a break, huh?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Hopeless, just hopeless,&quot; Sterno muttered, amused.<br />
  Ernie began to be able to make out an odd looking object in<br />
  the distance. It seemed to be some sort of primitive building. As<br />
  they approached, Ernie began to see it more clearly. It seemed to<br />
  be a house, made out of huge slabs of stone. Holes were cut in the<br />
  front slab for windows and a door. A huge flat slab made up the<br />
  roof. Sitting outside the house was a very odd object. It was a<br />
  wooden framework connected to two huge stone rollers. There was a<br />
  seat on the framework, and a piece of fur held up above the seat,<br />
  creating a primitive roof.<br />
  &quot;How odd,&quot; commented Sterno. &quot;Some sort of totem object, no<br />
  doubt. Perhaps a throne of some sort?&quot;<br />
  They approached the house. It began to look a bit familiar to<br />
  Ernie. Those fur curtains on the windows, where had he seen those<br />
  before? A neat walk led toward the front door. At the end of the<br />
  walk was a stone box, held up on a pole. There was something<br />
  written on the box. The name confirmed Ernie's worst fears: &quot;F.<br />
  FLINTSTONE&quot;.<br />
  &quot;Hey guys!&quot; Ernie called out.<br />
  &quot;Hmm?&quot; returned Captain Memory, continuing to walk toward the<br />
  house. He was, as usual, not paying much attention to Ernie.<br />
  &quot;Um, I don't think we should go in there!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Why not?&quot; Captain Memory did not even slow down.<br />
  &quot;I've got a real bad feeling about this place!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Aww, is the big, strong barbarian afraid of the little<br />
  house?&quot; sneered Sterno. &quot;Well, then he can just stay out here with<br />
  the saber-tooth tigers if he likes.&quot; The two of them continued into<br />
  the house, leaving Ernie standing alone on the front walk. Ernie<br />
  looked around. The sun was slowly edging towards the horizon,<br />
  casting long, menacing-looking shadows. Ernie found himself<br />
  anxiously looking around for places large enough for a saber-tooth<br />
  tiger to hide in. Well, he thought. There's not much point in<br />
  standing here. I might as well go in.<br />
  Stepping inside the doorway, Ernie found himself in a living<br />
  room, appointed with furniture made of stone and wood. Captain<br />
  Memory and Sterno had made themselves comfortable on the stone-and-<br />
  fur sofa. The owners of the house were nowhere in sight.<br />
  &quot;Rather luxurious for the Stone Age, don't you think?&quot;<br />
  commented Sterno. Captain Memory was, once again, engrossed in his<br />
  copy of the TV Guide. Ernie noticed, across from the sofa, what<br />
  appeared to be a roughly carved, stone television set. He moaned.<br />
  &quot;Whatever is the matter!&quot; said Sterno impatiently.<br />
  &quot;Hey guys,&quot; Ernie implored. &quot;I really think we ought to get<br />
  out of here. I think this is some kind of a trap, or something.&quot;<br />
  Sterno rolled his eyes upward. &quot;Paranoia,&quot; he commented. &quot;The<br />
  poor creature would like to think he's important enough for anyone<br />
  to bother persecuting.&quot; He turned to Ernie. &quot;Who in the world would<br />
  want to lay a trap for you? What possible use could they have for<br />
  you if they caught you?&quot;<br />
  Ernie shifted back and forth uncomfortably. Suddenly, an<br />
  object caught his eye. &quot;Paranoia, huh?&quot; he demanded. &quot;What about<br />
  THAT!&quot; He pointed to an object in a dark corner.<br />
  Ernie's exclamation was enough to tear Captain Memory's<br />
  attention away from his TV Guide. He peered at the object. It was<br />
  a box with what appeared to be a lens attached to it. As they<br />
  looked at it, it whirred quietly, moving the lens back and forth.<br />
  &quot;It's a hidden camera!&quot; Ernie cried triumphantly. &quot;We're being<br />
  watched!&quot;<br />
  Sterno was nonplussed. &quot;Where did that come from?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well, tear it out, then!&quot; Captain Memory said.<br />
  Ernie strode over to the dark corner, grabbed to camera and<br />
  yanked it out of it's mounting. He dashed it to the ground, where<br />
  it shattered, revealing feebly glowing electronic parts which<br />
  slowly, one by one, went out.<br />
  &quot;Well, so much for that,&quot; Captain Memory returned to the TV<br />
  Guide. <br />
  &quot;Is that ALL?!&quot; exclaimed Ernie.<br />
  &quot;Well, what else did you want?&quot; asked Captain Memory,<br />
  mystified.<br />
  &quot;Look, I just proved to you that this is some kind of a trap<br />
  or something!&quot; cried Ernie exasperatedly. &quot;There was a hidden<br />
  camera watching us, for heaven's sake!&quot;<br />
  &quot;So, you took it out.&quot; Captain Memory seemed perfectly<br />
  satisfied. &quot;So much for that.&quot;<br />
  Ernie was getting very frustrated. &quot;Well, well, what if<br />
  there's another?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, I very much doubt that,&quot; Sterno commented.<br />
  Captain Memory was still studying his TV Guide. &quot;Wanna watch<br />
  some TV?&quot; he asked brightly.<br />
  &quot;NO!&quot; Ernie was building up a real aversion to television.<br />
  &quot;Why not?&quot; Captain Memory couldn't imagine why anyone would<br />
  not want to watch TV.<br />
  &quot;Look,&quot; said Ernie desperately. &quot;This is the Stone Age, right?<br />
  There aren't supposed to be any TVs here. They haven't been<br />
  invented yet. This is before television!&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory chuckled.  &quot;Don't be silly! No time is before<br />
  television!&quot; He got up and walked over to the set.<br />
  &quot;How primitive,&quot; Sterno commented. &quot;No remote control. That's<br />
  only to be expected in the Stone Age, I suppose.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Look,&quot; said Ernie urgently. &quot;I'm positive there were no<br />
  televisions in the Stone Age!&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory sighed. &quot;Be reasonable,&quot; he said. &quot;have you<br />
  ever seen, oh, let's say `I Was a Teenage Caveman'?&quot;<br />
  Ernie thought a moment. &quot;Um, yes.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Where did you see it?&quot;<br />
  &quot;On TV.&quot;<br />
  &quot;It takes place in the Stone Age, right?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Um, yeah.&quot; Ernie wasn't sure he liked the way this line of<br />
  questioning was going.<br />
  &quot;Well, how could that be, UNLESS THERE WERE TELEVISIONS IN THE<br />
  STONE AGE!?&quot; Captain Memory cried triumphantly. &quot;I rest my case.&quot;<br />
  Sterno applauded. &quot;Bravo,&quot; he said politely.<br />
  &quot;Well...well...&quot; Ernie was sure there was something wrong with<br />
  this argument, but he couldn't quite figure out what it was. He<br />
  noticed that no-one was listening to him anyway.<br />
  Captain Memory switched on the television. Being a primitive<br />
  set, it took a long time to warm up.<br />
  A picture of a room very much like the one the three were in<br />
  appeared on the television screen, taken from an odd angle.<br />
  &quot;Eww, black-and-white,&quot; sniffed Sterno. &quot;This really is the<br />
  Stone Age, isn't it?&quot;<br />
  Ernie stared at the picture. A man in a comic-book-character<br />
  outfit, accompanied by a dog, entered the room, and they both sat<br />
  down. After a short wait, another figure, clad in a fur loincloth<br />
  and carrying a large plastic broadsword, also entered. The<br />
  characters seemed to be conversing, but their voices were too<br />
  indistinct to understand.<br />
  &quot;I can't hear what they're saying,&quot; Captain Memory said.<br />
  &quot;Seems to be a sound problem,&quot; Sterno sniffed. &quot;Only to be<br />
  expected from prehistoric TV stations.&quot;<br />
  Suddenly, one of the characters pointed directly at them.<br />
  &quot;...hidden camera!&quot; They heard the figure say. &quot;We're being<br />
  watched!&quot; The other characters said something indistinct. The<br />
  figure in the loincloth loomed larger and larger in the picture,<br />
  until finally the screen was entirely taken up by a face not unlike<br />
  Ernie's own. A huge hand loomed up over the screen, and the picture<br />
  went dead.<br />
  Ernie looked at the dead television screen. &quot;I don't like the<br />
  looks of this at all,&quot; he said warily.<br />
  &quot;Neither do I,&quot; agreed Captain Memory. &quot;Let's watch something<br />
  else.&quot; He changed the channel.<br />
  A different scene appeared. In it, two men were seated at a<br />
  large array of electronic equipment, their backs to the audience.<br />
  They were peering intently at their devices, and conversing.<br />
  &quot;Looks like they found the hidden camera,&quot; one said to the<br />
  other.<br />
  &quot;What are we gonna do?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Let's switch over to the second camera.&quot;<br />
  &quot;What if they find that one?&quot;<br />
  &quot;They won't. They don't suspect a thing.&quot;<br />
  The two men flipped some switches. &quot;Here we go,&quot; said the<br />
  first. &quot;Wanna see it?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Sure.&quot; The man flipped a switch. Suddenly, the scene changed<br />
  back to the room suspiciously like their own. The figure in the<br />
  loincloth appeared upset.<br />
  &quot;Hey!&quot; cried Ernie. &quot;`Hey!'&quot; cried the loincloth-clad figure<br />
  on the television. &quot;That's us!&quot; &quot;`That's us!'&quot; echoed his TV image.<br />
  Captain Memory regarded the television picture. &quot;Not a very<br />
  interesting show,&quot; he commented, echoed a moment later by the<br />
  comic-book-clad character on the television. &quot;Seems a bit<br />
  repetitious. Might as well turn it off.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Wait!&quot; Ernie cried, but it was too late. Captain Memory had<br />
  already shut off the set.<br />
  Captain Memory was confused. &quot;Wait? I thought you didn't want<br />
  to watch TV? I just turned it off to be nice. I can turn it back on<br />
  if you want.&quot; He reached toward the set.<br />
  &quot;NO! No, uh that's okay. Uh, thanks. I'd just as soon we<br />
  didn't watch anything right now, if you don't mind.&quot; Ernie was not<br />
  prepared for the possible consequences of turning on the TV again.<br />
  He had more than enough to deal with as it was.<br />
  Ernie gathered up his thoughts. &quot;Okay, guys, look. I gotta<br />
  tell you something. This place is not what it seems!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Really.&quot; Captain Memory had returned to the study of his<br />
  favorite reading matter, the TV Guide.<br />
  Ernie continued. &quot;This isn't a typical Stone Age house, okay?<br />
  It's actually a set from a 1960's cartoon series called  `The<br />
  Flintstones.'&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, we know THAT,&quot; Captain Memory commented, not bothering to<br />
  look up.<br />
  &quot;You DO?!&quot; Ernie was upset. &quot;Well, well, why didn't you SAY<br />
  something!?&quot;<br />
  &quot;You didn't ask.&quot;<br />
  Sterno was considering something Ernie had said a few moments<br />
  earlier. &quot;What makes you think `The Flintstones' isn't typical of<br />
  the Stone Age?&quot;<br />
  Ernie dropped into a chair. This was getting to be to much for<br />
  him, he thought. The more he argued about all of this, the more he<br />
  seemed to be losing ground. He wasn't even sure what point he was<br />
  losing ground on.<br />
  Ernie decided to try another approach. &quot;Okay, I give up. You<br />
  tell me, then: What is going on?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, you want to know what's going on!&quot; said the Captain<br />
  brightly. He always enjoyed telling stories. &quot;Why didn't you say<br />
  so! Well,&quot; he went on, warming up to his subject. &quot;All of this is<br />
  totally artificial. It was put here to be a trap...&quot;<br />
  &quot;That's what I was trying to tell you!&quot; cried Ernie excitedly.<br />
  &quot;It's a trap! I knew it!&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory was annoyed. &quot;Do you want to hear this or do<br />
  you want to talk?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Sorry.&quot; Ernie shut up.<br />
  &quot;Where was I?&quot; Captain Memory gathered his thoughts. &quot;Oh yes.<br />
  Anyway, this is part of a game called `THE FLINTSTONES', in which<br />
  Fred and Barney thwart an attempt by aliens to take over the Earth<br />
  back in the Stone Age. It's really quite elaborate.&quot;<br />
  &quot;An excellent game,&quot; Sterno added. &quot;I've played it myself.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Anyway,&quot; Captain Memory continued. &quot;This house is actually a<br />
  trap set by the aliens to try to capture Earth people. We knew<br />
  that, but we thought we'd come in here anyway, because it's more<br />
  comfortable than a cave, don't you think?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Aha!&quot; cried Sterno.<br />
  &quot;What?!&quot; Ernie was startled.<br />
  &quot;Cigars!&quot; Sterno had found a stone jar, and opened it. He<br />
  pulled out a cigar and examined it, sniffing it carefully. &quot;They're<br />
  not very good, but I suppose they'll have to do. One must, after<br />
  all, make allowances in the Stone Age.&quot; He lit one, puffing little<br />
  clouds of blue smoke into the air. Captain Memory returned to the<br />
  TV Guide.<br />
  &quot;So, what about these aliens?&quot; Ernie inquired. &quot;What do they<br />
  want?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, I don't know. Typical alien stuff, I imagine. `Take me to<br />
  your leader', conquer the world, steal your brain. You know, all<br />
  that stuff aliens always do.&quot;<br />
  Ernie was mystified. &quot;But why?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, I don't know. Probably from watching old science fiction<br />
  movies on TV. The aliens seem to think that sort of thing is<br />
  expected of them.&quot;<br />
  Ernie wasn't following this. &quot;Watching TV? Aliens watch TV?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Of course,&quot; Captain Memory went on. &quot;You'd have to expect<br />
  something like that to happen. After all, we've been beaming those<br />
  radio and television waves out into outer space for years. It was<br />
  only a matter of time until someone picked them up. Do you realize<br />
  that there are civilizations forty light years from here that are<br />
  now watching 1950's situation comedies? What do you suppose they<br />
  think of that?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well...&quot; Ernie began.<br />
  &quot;Did you ever think that they might consider it a hostile<br />
  act?&quot; Captain Memory continued animatedly. &quot;They might think having<br />
  &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; reruns beamed at them is an act of war.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Huh?&quot; Ernie wasn't following this too well.<br />
  &quot;Well, look at it from their point of view,&quot; Captain Memory<br />
  explained. &quot;Here they are, they come home from a hard day at, well,<br />
  whatever it is they do, they just wanna watch a little TV, you<br />
  know? So they flip on their set, and what do they get? `Mr. Ed',<br />
  `The Flintstones', `I Love Lucy'! They don't wanna watch this! They<br />
  wanna watch, you know, ALIEN shows!&quot;<br />
  Ernie considered this. &quot;I Love Lucy, huh? Well, I can see<br />
  their point.&quot;<br />
  &quot;So maybe they decide to flip on the stereo,&quot; Captain Memory<br />
  continued. &quot;And what do they get? The Chiffons, the Ronettes, Chuck<br />
  Berry! Maybe they don't like rock n' roll! Did you ever think of<br />
  that?&quot;<br />
  &quot;No,&quot; Ernie was amazed. &quot;I thought everybody liked rock n'<br />
  roll!&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory shook his head sadly. &quot;You can't take anything<br />
  for granted in Outer Space.&quot;<br />
  Ernie found this disturbing. &quot;Maybe it wasn't such a good idea<br />
  to let all those TV waves get out into space, then.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Probably not,&quot; agreed Captain Memory. &quot;But, it's too late<br />
  now. We'll just have to deal with the consequences.&quot;<br />
  Ernie didn't like that word `consequences.' He would rather<br />
  not think about what the `consequences' of all of this might be. He<br />
  rubbed his head. He especially didn't like that `steal your brain'<br />
  business.<br />
  &quot;So, what are we gonna do?&quot; Ernie wanted to know.<br />
  &quot;Do?&quot; repeated Captain Memory distantly. He had returned to<br />
  reading.<br />
  Ernie heard a shout far in the distance. He strained his ears.<br />
  There it was again! It sounded like...`Yabba-dabba-doo?'<br />
  &quot;Look, I think we ought to get out of here,&quot; Ernie pleaded. &quot;I<br />
  think something bad is gonna happen if we don't leave, like, right<br />
  now!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, my! What a coincidence!&quot; cried Captain Memory.<br />
  &quot;What now?&quot; Ernie asked uneasily.<br />
  &quot;You'll never guess what's on! And here we were, talking about<br />
  almost that very thing just a moment ago!&quot;<br />
  Ernie had a bad feeling about this. &quot;Not...&quot;<br />
  &quot;That's right!&quot; returned Captain Memory jovially. &quot;TRUTH OR<br />
  CONSEQUENCES!&quot;<br />
  &quot;I really don't wanna watch...&quot; But it was too late. Captain<br />
  Memory had already flipped on the set.<br />
  The set came on. &quot;...and here's our host,&quot; the announcer was<br />
  saying. &quot;That fabulous Frenchman, Henri Gruyere!&quot;<br />
  &quot;This isn't the `Truth or Consequences' I remember!&quot; said<br />
  Ernie suspiciously. As usual, no-one was listening.<br />
  &quot;Gut efening, ladies und gentlemen!&quot; the host was saying. He<br />
  was an unpleasant-looking man wearing a traditional French outfit:<br />
  red-striped shirt, scarf, beret. The only things that seemed a bit<br />
  out of place were his monocle and jackboots.<br />
  &quot;First of all,&quot; he continued. &quot;I vould like to point out dot<br />
  I am French. I am not German. Not at all. Not efen a little bit.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Wait a minute,&quot; said Sterno suspiciously. &quot; Something smells<br />
  here!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Hmm?&quot; Captain Memory looked up unconcernedly.<br />
  &quot;Think about it!&quot; cried Sterno. &quot;Don't you realize..!? His<br />
  name! Gruyere! It's...CHEESE!&quot;<br />
  But, it was, as usual, too late. Sudden brightness dazzled<br />
  Ernie's eyes. As his vision cleared, he found himself standing on<br />
  a game-show stage, with Captain Memory and Sterno beside him. He<br />
  blinked and staggered, disoriented by the sudden change of scene.<br />
  He moaned and held his head until the sickening swimming sensation<br />
  stopped.<br />
  Ernie looked up. He was facing the audience. He noticed<br />
  something odd about the people watching. Oh, that's it, he thought.<br />
  They're all wearing Nazi uniforms.<br />
  &quot;I thought you said this couldn't happen,&quot; he said to Captain<br />
  Memory accusingly. &quot;I thought you said there was a million-to-one<br />
  chance of us getting sucked in through a TV again!&quot;<br />
  Captain memory shrugged. &quot;So I was wrong,&quot; he admitted. &quot;So<br />
  sue me!&quot;<br />
  The game shoe host turned to the threesome. &quot;Perhaps you vould<br />
  like to step through door number three?&quot; the host said to them.<br />
  Ernie turned around. A number of very nice prizes were<br />
  displayed on the stage: a red sports car, furniture, some shiny new<br />
  appliances. Several very attractive women in cut-down outfits were<br />
  standing around the stage. Unfortunately, they all carried guns,<br />
  which they held trained on Ernie and the others.<br />
  Captain Memory was replying to the talk show host, &quot;No, I<br />
  don't think we would care to step through door number three. Thanks<br />
  just the same.&quot;<br />
  The talk show host laughed unpleasantly. &quot;I vould strongly<br />
  recommend dot you step through door number three!&quot; he said<br />
  urgently.<br />
  &quot;No, we'd really rather not,&quot; answered the Captain pleasantly.<br />
  The host's face darkened. &quot;You vill shtep through dat door!<br />
  NOW!&quot; The women's fingers tightened menacingly on their triggers.<br />
  &quot;Oh, well, if you put it that way,&quot; the three of them found<br />
  themselves prodded towards door number three. The door opened in<br />
  front of them, and they found themselves thrust into blackness. The<br />
  door slammed behind them with a resounding crash. <br />
  Ernie blinked. As his eyes began to adjust, he could see that<br />
  the room they were in was not entirely dark. A small amount of<br />
  light came in from a barred window high up on the opposite wall.<br />
  They were in a large chamber with damp stone walls and a dirt<br />
  floor. It seemed to be...a dungeon.<br />
  &quot;Oh great,&quot; Ernie muttered. &quot;So this is what's behind door<br />
  number three!&quot;<br />
  &quot;It could've been worse,&quot; said Captain Memory jovially.<br />
  &quot;Oh yeah?&quot; Ernie returned glumly. &quot;How?&quot;<br />
  &quot;It could've been door number four.&quot;<br />
  &quot;So? What's the big deal about door number four?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh,&quot; Captain Memory shook his head. &quot;You don't ever want to<br />
  go behind door number four!&quot;<br />
  Ernie didn't like the sound of that. &quot;So, what is it?&quot;<br />
  &quot;It's the worst,&quot; Captain Memory went on ominously. &quot;I mean,<br />
  it's just too horrible...&quot;<br />
  A voice came from out of the darkness. &quot;Hi, guys!&quot;<br />
  Ernie was taken aback. It hadn't occurred to him that someone<br />
  else might be in the dungeon with them.<br />
  A figure approached from out of the darkness. Ernie gasped. It<br />
  was a horrendous creature with the body of a human, but the<br />
  tremendously enlarged head of a fly, complete with huge, faceted<br />
  eyes, antennae, and a long, trunk-like snout. It was wearing rather<br />
  a nice designer suit. &quot;Say,&quot; the creature continued. &quot;Have any of<br />
  you guys seen my date?&quot; <br />
  Ernie stared soundlessly. <br />
  Captain Memory shrugged. &quot;Sorry.&quot;<br />
  The creature sighed. &quot;She seemed like such a nice girl, too.&quot;<br />
  The creature shuffled back and forth, scuffing his expensive<br />
  designer shoes in the dirt.<br />
  Ernie peered at the creature. He didn't seem to be menacing at<br />
  all. Quite the contrary. In fact, he seemed quite unhappy. But then<br />
  again, Ernie thought, it's kind of hard to read expressions on a<br />
  fly.<br />
  &quot;Aww, that's okay, guys,&quot; the Fly said sadly. &quot;You don't have<br />
  to tell me. I can figure it out. She took off, right?&quot; He sighed.<br />
  &quot;Just like all the others.&quot; <br />
  Poor guy, Ernie thought. His date stood him up. Ernie could<br />
  sympathize; he'd been in situations like that himself. Of course,<br />
  this guy did have an unusual problem.<br />
  &quot;I know,&quot; the Fly continued. &quot;It's my looks, right?&quot; His<br />
  antennae drooped sadly. &quot;One little accident, and there goes your<br />
  whole social life.&quot;<br />
  Ernie felt awkward. What was he expected to say in a situation<br />
  like this?<br />
  Nothing, apparently, for the Fly went on: &quot;I mean, I've got a<br />
  nice personality, I'm intelligent, I'm a fun guy, you know? I got<br />
  a good job, a nice car, I paid a lotta money for this suit.&quot; He<br />
  fingered the expensive silk lapels. &quot;But girls nowadays, do they<br />
  care? Naw, all they care about is looks!&quot; The Fly continued<br />
  animatedly. He really seemed to appreciate the opportunity to get<br />
  all of this off his chest. &quot;I mean, I go into a bar, you know, not<br />
  one of those sleazy places, but a nice singles spot, where the<br />
  drinks cost like five bucks each, you know? I figure, maybe I can<br />
  meet some nice girls here. So, I see some cute chick, I try to<br />
  start up a conversation, and, like, does she even give me a chance?<br />
  Hell, no! I mean, she doesn't even wait to find out, like, what I'm<br />
  all about or anything. It's just `gasp, scream, faint,' `gasp,<br />
  scream, faint,' the same old thing over and over again. I mean,<br />
  what kind of a way is that to behave?  Don't girls have any manners<br />
  anymore?&quot; He sighed. &quot;Looks. All they care about is looks.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Gee, that's...too bad,&quot; Ernie really didn't know what to say.<br />
  &quot;Thanks, guy,&quot; the Fly answered. &quot;I really appreciate it. I<br />
  don't get to talk to too many people around here, you know?&quot;<br />
  A disturbing thought occurred to Ernie. &quot;Is this guy okay?&quot; he<br />
  whispered to Captain Memory. &quot;I mean, he's not an alien or<br />
  anything, is he?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, no,&quot; laughed Captain Memory. &quot;He's the Fly! You saw the<br />
  movie, didn't you?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well, yeah,&quot; admitted Ernie. &quot;But I thought it was, well, a<br />
  movie!&quot;<br />
  &quot;You see?&quot; replied Captain Memory. &quot;I told you it could be<br />
  worse. At least you're trapped in Cyperspace as yourself. He's<br />
  trapped as the Fly!&quot;<br />
  Ernie had to admit that the Captain was right about that.<br />
  Still, it didn't make him fell much better.<br />
  &quot;Anyway,&quot; continued Captain Memory, looking at the Fly. &quot;The<br />
  aliens are much prettier.&quot;<br />
  &quot;I say,&quot; said Sterno to the Fly. &quot;You wouldn't happen to have<br />
  a cigar on you by any chance, would you?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Sure, guy,&quot; the Fly pulled out an expensive gold cigar case<br />
  and flipped it open. <br />
  Sterno removed a cigar and examined it. &quot;Lovely!&quot; He seemed<br />
  very pleased. &quot;Havana, no less! Thanks ever so much!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Hey, my pleasure,&quot; The Fly seemed to enjoy the opportunity to<br />
  show off his fine-quality things. It seemed to Ernie that the Fly<br />
  had gone to a lot of trouble to get the best of everything, but<br />
  didn't have much opportunity to impress people with it.<br />
  &quot;Are we going to be leaving here soon?&quot; Sterno inquired of<br />
  Captain Memory. &quot;It is awfully damp in here, and it rather bothers<br />
  my sinuses.&quot;<br />
  Ernie shivered. The dampness was getting to him, too. Wearing<br />
  only a loincloth as he was, he had little protection from the<br />
  chill.<br />
  &quot;Hey, I like the loincloth, guy,&quot; the Fly said to Ernie.<br />
  &quot;That`s the new `in' thing, right? Maybe I'll get one. You think<br />
  the girls would go for it?&quot; Ernie didn't know how to reply.<br />
  &quot;Well, I guess there's no point in hanging around here much<br />
  longer,&quot; Captain Memory decided. &quot;After all, there's no TV.&quot;<br />
  &quot;You guys gonna leave?&quot; The Fly seemed crestfallen, or<br />
  perhaps, antenna-fallen. &quot;But you just got here!&quot; He brightened.<br />
  &quot;Hey, you guys are gonna go someplace fun, right? Can I come? Huh?<br />
  Can I?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well...&quot; Captain Memory began.<br />
  &quot;Do you know how we can get out of here?&quot; Sterno inquired.<br />
  &quot;Hey, no problem!&quot; answered the Fly. &quot;You can take the 5:15<br />
  out of LaGuardia, and that'll get you there in about, oh, two hours<br />
  forty minutes, but if you want the special rate you gotta stay from<br />
  Sunday through Saturday but not any Mondays, or you can take the<br />
  6:25 out of O'Hare, but then you gotta...&quot;<br />
  &quot;What about the door?&quot; Ernie broke in.<br />
  &quot;Oh.&quot; The Fly was disappointed. He enjoyed showing off his<br />
  detailed knowledge of travel arrangements. &quot;Yeah, well, there's<br />
  always the door.&quot;<br />
  Ernie looked at the door. It was made of heavy steel, and<br />
  seemed to be secure bolted. &quot;So, how do we open it?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Just knock.&quot; The Fly seemed to think this was all too simple,<br />
  and therefore not very much fun.<br />
  Ernie knocked. He heard the sound of a bolt being thrown back,<br />
  and the door creaked open. Outside were two burly guards in black<br />
  Nazi SS uniforms. &quot;Ja?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Uh, is it okay if we go now?&quot; Ernie asked brightly.<br />
  &quot;NEIN!&quot; The door slammed.<br />
  &quot;Oh, not like that!&quot; The Fly seemed impatient. &quot;You gotta use,<br />
  like, subterfuge, you know? Here, I'll show you!&quot; The Fly was<br />
  pleased to have another opportunity to show off his expertise at<br />
  something. He knocked on the door.<br />
  The door creaked open again. &quot;Ja?&quot;<br />
  &quot;I gotta go to the bathroom!&quot; the Fly said urgently.<br />
  The guards looked at each other. &quot;Vhat are ve supposed to do<br />
  now? Dey didn't tell us vhat to do if dis happened.&quot; They looked<br />
  hesitant. &quot;Vell, I don't know. I don't tink so...&quot;<br />
  Sensing failure, the Fly quickly switched tactics. &quot;Hey,<br />
  look!&quot; he cried, pointing past the guards. &quot;A naked lady!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Vhere?! VHERE?!&quot; cried the guards, peering into the distance.<br />
  The Fly threw his entire weight against the door, which flew open.<br />
  &quot;RUN!&quot; he cried to the others. He sprinted toward center stage,<br />
  followed by Ernie, Sterno, and Captain Memory.<br />
  A startled von Liederkranz was on center stage, trying to<br />
  flirt with the chorus girls. &quot;Guards!&quot; he cried. &quot;Don't let dem get<br />
  avay!&quot; He grabbed the nearest weapon, which, in this case happened<br />
  to be an alien Blaster of unknown properties. He aimed it at the<br />
  foursome, who were sprinting towards a door marked &quot;EXIT&quot;. &quot;Shtop,<br />
  or I'll shoot!&quot; Von Liederkranz threatened. The four continued to<br />
  run. Von Liederkranz pulled the trigger.<br />
  A huge ball of magneto-gravitational energy flashed from the<br />
  muzzle of the Blaster, instantly hurtling Ernie and the others into<br />
  a totally different Space-Time Continuum. <br />
  Von Liederkranz looked ruefully at the Blaster, and then at<br />
  the smoking hole in the stage where the foursome had been only a<br />
  nanosecond earlier. &quot;Vell,&quot; von Liederkranz admitted. &quot;Perhaps dot<br />
  vasn't der best veapon to use.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Chapter 3</p>
<p> Ernie, Captain Memory, Sterno, and the Fly sat on a rocky<br />
  crag, overlooking a lifeless purple sea. They watched the waves<br />
  crash against the rocks beneath them.<br />
  Ernie sighed. &quot;So, where are we now?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well, as far as I can figure out,&quot; said Captain Memory<br />
  thoughtfully. &quot;We seem to have been blasted back to somewhere on<br />
  the order of four billion B.C. Life has not evolved yet on Earth.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Huh?&quot; said Ernie. &quot;You mean, we traveled in time?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Of course not,&quot; the Captain replied. &quot;What really happened is<br />
  that we got sent to another sector of Cyberspace. Probably by<br />
  accident.&quot; Captain Memory looked around. &quot;After all, I can't see<br />
  any reason for Von Liederkranz to have sent us here on purpose!&quot;<br />
  Ernie looked out over the purple waves. &quot;So, where ARE we? I<br />
  mean, really?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory thought a moment. &quot;We're probably in somebody's<br />
  Geology program. You know, like computer models of primeval Earth?&quot;<br />
  He looked at the barren landscape. &quot;While we didn't actually travel<br />
  in time, it's almost as if we did. This is like actually being on<br />
  Earth at the beginning of life.&quot;<br />
  Wow, thought Ernie. That's really cosmic.<br />
  The Fly looked at the bare rocks around them. &quot;You know, man,<br />
  this place is, like, really dead.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Exactly,&quot; Captain Memory agreed.<br />
  &quot;I mean,&quot; the Fly went on. &quot;There is, like, no girls. None at<br />
  all.&quot;<br />
  &quot;That's right.&quot;<br />
  &quot;So, like, what good is it?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory thought a moment. &quot;Good question.&quot;<br />
  Ernie watched the orange sun, in a green sky, which was slowly<br />
  setting against a purple sea. &quot;This is really a weird scene,&quot; he<br />
  commented. &quot;I have never seen anything like this. Not even on TV.&quot;<br />
  He thought about that for a moment. &quot;Not even on TV? Why, that<br />
  could mean that there's...&quot;<br />
  &quot;No TV,&quot; Captain Memory agreed. &quot;Not much reason to stay here<br />
  then, is there?&quot;<br />
  Ernie noticed a motion out of the corner of his eye. &quot;I'm not<br />
  sure you ought to throw those cigar butts on the ground here,&quot; he<br />
  said to Sterno.<br />
  Sterno looked annoyed. &quot;Why in the world not?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well, I don't know that much about this,&quot; Ernie said. &quot;But it<br />
  seems to me I read somewhere that the further you go back in time,<br />
  the more effect your actions have on the future. Therefore, if we<br />
  make even little changes way back here in four billion B.C., it<br />
  might have some kind of real big effect by the time we get back to<br />
  our own time.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Utterly ridiculous,&quot; scoffed Sterno, flicking cigar ash into<br />
  the sea.&quot;This isn't REALLY four billion B.C., it's only a computer<br />
  model of four billion B.C.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well, yeah,&quot; Ernie admitted uneasily. &quot;But the Captain said<br />
  that this was almost the same as really being there. And, I dunno,<br />
  I just have a real bad feeling about those cigar butts.&quot; <br />
  &quot;Really.&quot; Sterno looked totally bored. &quot;I just can't tell you<br />
  how concerned that makes me.&quot; He yawned.<br />
  &quot;Well, well, I just don't think it's a good idea, that's all.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well, you know how it goes,&quot; said Captain Memory jovially.<br />
  &quot;It's all just six of one, twelve dozen of another.&quot;<br />
  Ernie frowned. &quot;I don't think that's right.<br />
  &quot;Isn't it? Oh well,&quot; said Captain Memory cheerily. &quot;Math was<br />
  never one of my strong points. Anyway, no time to worry about that<br />
  now. Let's be off, shall we?&quot;  He though a moment. &quot;Let's try some<br />
  Machine Language: 010F E4 61.&quot; The scene vanished.</p>
<p> *    *    *</p>
<p> The foursome found themselves standing in the middle of a road<br />
  in bright sunlight. Once again, Ernie blinked and staggered, his<br />
  stomach doing flip-flops. As his vision cleared, He could see<br />
  around him what appeared to be an idyllic country scene. A rustic<br />
  rail fence bordered the road. Beyond the fence stood farms,<br />
  surrounded by fields full of amber waves of grain. In the distance<br />
  stood majestic purple mountains. Ernie turned around. Behind them<br />
  lay a broad plain. Ernie was pretty sure there was fruit on it.<br />
  &quot;I wonder where we are?&quot; the Fly asked.<br />
  Sterno looked around. &quot;Kansas?&quot; he suggested.<br />
  Ernie began to get that queasy feeling in the pit of his<br />
  stomach again. A look down confirmed his worst fears: the road was<br />
  yellow brick.<br />
  &quot;I don't think I like this,&quot; said Ernie warily.<br />
  Sterno rolled his eyes upward. &quot;You never like anything!&quot;<br />
  Ernie tried to explain. &quot;Well, you see...&quot;<br />
  &quot;I know, I know,&quot; Sterno interrupted. &quot;You have a really bad<br />
  feeling about this. You've seen it all before. You think it's a<br />
  trap.&quot;<br />
  Ernie thought a moment. &quot;Well...yeah.&quot;<br />
  Sterno sighed. &quot;You know, this is all becoming really<br />
  tiresome. I do SO wish you'd find something else to go on about!&quot;<br />
  Ernie thought a moment. Suddenly, he smiled broadly. &quot;Hey, I<br />
  get it! This is all really just a game, right?&quot;<br />
  Sterno moaned. &quot;Not THAT again!&quot; Even Captain Memory looked<br />
  annoyed.<br />
  The Fly was confused. &quot;Like, what is this guy talking about?&quot;<br />
  he asked Captain Memory. The Captain just rolled his eyes upward<br />
  and made little spinning motions around his temple with his<br />
  forefinger.<br />
  &quot;Oh, wow,&quot; the Fly went on. &quot;So is this guy, like, crazy, or<br />
  what?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well, you know how it is,&quot; Captain Memory explained, not<br />
  unsympathetically. &quot;Some people just don't deal well with travel.<br />
  It's too stressful for them. It upsets their systems.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, wow,&quot; said the Fly compassionately. &quot;Poor guy.&quot;<br />
  Ernie was annoyed. &quot;Awright, you guys, knock it off, okay? I<br />
  mean, enough is enough, all right?&quot; Actually, he thought there was<br />
  probably quite a bit of truth to what Captain  Memory had been<br />
  saying. The stress probably WAS upsetting his system. However, even<br />
  if he agreed with what the Captain had to say, he resented his tone<br />
  of voice.<br />
  &quot;So, like, what are we gonna do now, guys?&quot; the Fly wanted to<br />
  know.<br />
  &quot;Well,&quot; the Captain began jovially. &quot;I guess we'll just have<br />
  to follow the...&quot;<br />
  &quot;DON'T SAY IT!&quot; Ernie broke in. &quot;Okay?! Just don't say it!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Touchy, touchy,&quot; sniffed Sterno.<br />
  Captain Memory was somewhat taken aback. &quot;Well...have it your<br />
  way. Let's go that way.&quot; He gestured down the road.<br />
  The Fly shook his head. &quot;I shoulda known. Anybody who'd wear<br />
  a loincloth like that...&quot; He noticed Ernie glaring at him, and<br />
  stopped. &quot;Hey, no offense...&quot; He shrugged.<br />
  Ernie scowled.<br />
  They began walking down the road. Ernie peered ahead. Far<br />
  ahead down the road, he seemed to see something large and green.<br />
  Big and green?, Ernie thought. Is that, the Emerald...?<br />
  Suddenly, Ernie had an idea. He stopped, clicked his heels<br />
  together three times, clenched his eyes tightly shut, and said<br />
  &quot;There's no place like home. There's no place like home. There's no<br />
  place like home!&quot;<br />
  He opened his eyes. The other three were standing around him,<br />
  staring. &quot;What is WRONG with you?!&quot; Sterno demanded.<br />
  Ernie was acutely aware of everyone watching him. &quot;I'm having<br />
  a bad day, okay?&quot; he said defensively. &quot;Just leave me alone!&quot; He<br />
  began walking forward again, quickly.<br />
  &quot;My, aren't we sensitive today!&quot; Sterno said snidely.<br />
  The Fly shook his head sadly. &quot;The human mind is such a<br />
  fragile thing!&quot;<br />
  They proceeded down the road. The green object in the distance<br />
  began to resolve itself into some kind of building. Ernie continued<br />
  to be very unhappy about the entire situation, but decided he was<br />
  sick of being made fun of, and said nothing.<br />
  They approached the green building. It was done in Greek-<br />
  revival style, with huge Classical columns in the front. &quot;Hey, it's<br />
  a bank!&quot; noticed the Fly. &quot;Do you suppose I can cash a check?&quot;<br />
  The letters carved into the Greek-style pediment of the<br />
  building did, in fact, identify it as a bank. Ernie was confused.<br />
  He hadn't expected to find a bank here.<br />
  &quot;Why would there be a bank here?&quot; Ernie asked incredulously.<br />
  Captain Memory regarded the building. &quot;Looks like we might<br />
  have run into a piece of somebody's business program. Accounting,<br />
  or bank operations or something.&quot; He shook his head. &quot;That's what<br />
  happens when you start sticking a bunch of unrelated systems<br />
  together. You never know WHAT you're going to wind up with!&quot;<br />
  They proceeded up the long, marble stairway and entered the<br />
  bank. The interior was huge and very ornate, done in Victorian<br />
  style. Everything seemed antique, as though the bank were right out<br />
  of the 19th century. They walked up to a row of teller's windows,<br />
  each of which was protected by elaborate Victorian grillwork. <br />
  The Fly pulled a very nice quality leather checkbook out of<br />
  his suit pocket. &quot;Hey,&quot; he said to the teller, a rather prim-<br />
  looking young woman. &quot;Can you cash a check?&quot;<br />
  &quot;I'm sorry, we can't.&quot; She didn't really seem to be sorry at<br />
  all. &quot;We can't do anything right now.  Our computers are down.&quot;<br />
  Ernie looked around. He saw men at high desks carefully<br />
  copying numbers with long quill pens. Nowhere was there any sign of<br />
  electricity, much less computers. &quot;You don't have any computers,&quot;<br />
  Ernie said suspiciously.<br />
  The teller's expression turned ugly. &quot;Well, we're still not<br />
  going to cash your check,&quot; she snapped.<br />
  &quot;Why not?&quot; The Fly wanted to know.<br />
  &quot;We can't do any business. Our...our accountant has gone<br />
  crazy!&quot; she concluded triumphantly.<br />
  Ernie looked at the teller suspiciously. Something very<br />
  peculiar was going on here. However, he decided not to say anything<br />
  about it because he didn't want to be made fun of.<br />
  &quot;I wanna talk to the manager,&quot; the Fly decided.<br />
  &quot;Good,&quot; the teller sneered. &quot;The manager would like to talk to<br />
  all of you, RIGHT NOW!&quot;<br />
  The teller came out from behind the counter and led them all<br />
  into a room which looked very much like a bank office. There,<br />
  behind a very large desk, sat a disagreeable-looking old woman with<br />
  a sour expression. Ernie somehow knew that the woman had something<br />
  unpleasant in mind for them.<br />
  &quot;Well, it's about time!&quot; she snapped as they entered the room.<br />
  &quot;There's a little matter of an unpaid balance to be taken care of!&quot;<br />
  Ernie looked at the woman. She was wearing a severely tailored<br />
  grey suit, with her greying hair pulled back in a tight bun. For<br />
  some reason, however, she was wearing shoes that didn't match her<br />
  outfit. They were a brilliant, sparkling red.<br />
  The Fly approached the desk. &quot;Hey, I got this check...&quot;<br />
  &quot;Just one minute!&quot; The manager cut him off rudely. &quot;There's a<br />
  little matter to be taken care of first!&quot; She pulled out a sheaf of<br />
  papers. &quot;We have an invoice here for `Time Continuum Repair and<br />
  Reality Maintenance' which was referred to our department for non-<br />
  payment. Which of you is going to take care of this matter?&quot;<br />
  Sterno was becoming impatient. &quot;What ARE you talking about?&quot;<br />
  The manager began reading from the papers. &quot;It seems there was<br />
  a little problem with cigars butts left at four billion B.C.&quot;<br />
  Ernie glared at Sterno, who looked innocently off into the air,<br />
  twiddling his thumbs. &quot;It seems these foreign materials left at<br />
  such an early point caused slime creatures to evolve into the<br />
  dominant life form on Earth. Precluding this disgusting development<br />
  required a maintenance order which took, let me see,&quot; she flipped<br />
  through the pages and pulled out a sheet marked &quot;Work Order&quot;. &quot;Here<br />
  it is: one million, two hundred and fifty-two thousand and three<br />
  standard Earth years, and forty-five minutes. Now, at $39.75 per<br />
  hour, plus time-and-a-half for overtime, and double-time on<br />
  Sundays, that comes to,&quot; she flipped through some more pages &quot;One<br />
  hundred and ninety-five quadrillion, four hundred and twelve<br />
  trillion, seven hundred and seventy-one billion, two hundred and<br />
  thirteen million, three hundred and twelve thousand and thirty-two<br />
  dollars and twenty-nine cents.&quot; She peered at Captain Memory.<br />
  &quot;Would you like to take care of this balance at this time?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory shrugged. &quot;Don't look at me! I don't have any<br />
  money.&quot;<br />
  The manager peered at the Fly, who looked uncomfortable. &quot;Hey,<br />
  sorry, but I got obligations, you know? I got car payments, I gotta<br />
  pay the rent...&quot; He trailed off.<br />
  The bank manager looked at Ernie. Ernie laughed. This was all<br />
  just too ridiculous. &quot;Sure, put it on my charge,&quot; he said<br />
  flippantly.<br />
  The bank manager smiled maliciously. &quot;Mr. Ernest Ross,&quot; she<br />
  said in an disagreeable tone of voice, carefully writing his name<br />
  on the invoice with a quill pen.<br />
  Captain Memory looked at Ernie, horrified. &quot;Oh, you shouldn't<br />
  have said that,&quot; he said in an ominous tone.<br />
  Ernie began to get the feeling that maybe he had made a big<br />
  mistake. The bank manager looked up at him. &quot;Now, when may we<br />
  expect payment?&quot;<br />
  Ernie looked desperately to the others. They were all<br />
  pointedly ignoring him. &quot;Look,&quot; he said urgently. &quot;Forget I said<br />
  that, okay? I take it back!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, I'm sorry,&quot; she said in a tone of malicious sweetness.<br />
  &quot;I'm afraid you can't do that. Now, will you be paying in cash or<br />
  by check?&quot;<br />
  &quot;A hundred and ninety-five quadrillion dollars,&quot; said the Fly<br />
  wonderingly. &quot;That's a lot of money. That's more than I make in a<br />
  week!&quot;<br />
  Ernie was beginning to panic. &quot;No! I won't! Forget it! I'm not<br />
  going to pay that bill!&quot; <br />
  &quot;You'll pay this bill, my fine little friend,&quot; the bank<br />
  manager cackled. &quot;Or I'll take care of you,&quot; she looked at Sterno,<br />
  &quot;and your little dog, too!&quot; She laughed nastily.<br />
  &quot;What a witch!&quot; the Fly commented.<br />
  Suddenly, Ernie had a brilliant idea. He grabbed a vase of<br />
  flowers off the desk, yanked the flowers out of it, and threw the<br />
  water all over the bank manager.<br />
  &quot;Eeyah!&quot; she screamed. &quot;I'm all wet!&quot;<br />
  The Fly looked at Ernie wonderingly. &quot;Why in the world did you<br />
  do that?&quot;<br />
  Ernie looked at the bank manager. She was glaring and hissing<br />
  at him, water dripping off her face. She was not melting at all.<br />
  Ernie became uncomfortably aware of everyone staring at him. &quot;Uh,<br />
  well, I thought...&quot; Ernie stuttered.<br />
  &quot;You'll have to excuse our friend,&quot; Captain Memory ad-libbed<br />
  quickly. &quot;It's the stress, you see. Financial problems. He's not<br />
  coping...&quot; The three began hustling Ernie towards the door.<br />
  The bank manager arose, hissing and spitting. &quot;You haven't<br />
  heard the last of this,&quot; she shrieked. &quot;You'll see!<br />
  The four rushed quickly through the bank and back out onto the<br />
  road. The stopped to get their bearings.<br />
  &quot;Well, I hope you're satisfied,&quot; Sterno said contemptuously to<br />
  Ernie. &quot;You've really made a mess of things now!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Me!&quot; cried Ernie. &quot;Hey, I'm not the one who left those cigar<br />
  butts back in four billion B.C. It's not MY fault...&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, sure,&quot; Sterno interrupted. &quot;Try and blame it on me...&quot;<br />
  &quot;Hey, guys!&quot; the Fly broke in. &quot;Look at that!&quot; <br />
  The Fly's huge, multi-faceted eyes had picked up a detail the<br />
  others had failed to notice: behind the bank was a small, flat-<br />
  roofed brick building. A neon sign proclaimed: Deer Bar. There was<br />
  a large picture of a deer beneath it.<br />
  &quot;Hey, guys, it's a bar!&quot; the Fly continued. &quot;Whaddya say we<br />
  stop in for a drink? Hey, maybe we can meet some girls!&quot;<br />
  The others looked at each others confusedly. &quot;Hey, it's okay,<br />
  guys!&quot; The Fly went on. &quot;I'll buy!&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory looked relieved. &quot;Well, in that case, sure!<br />
  Thanks!&quot; They all started towards the bar.<br />
  Ernie was finding all of this very confusing. Every time he<br />
  thought he was beginning to understand what was going on, events<br />
  took a turn in an entirely different direction. Wasn't this<br />
  supposed to be the Emerald City? He didn't recall any bars in the<br />
  Emerald City! And what about that bank? And what happened to Judy<br />
  Garland? They entered the bar. Well, Ernie thought. I'm not sure if<br />
  this is a good idea or not, but I could really use a drink.<br />
  Ernie found the interior of the bar reassuring. It was cool<br />
  and dark. It looked like a typical corner bar, with a typical<br />
  corner bartender. In one corner behind the bar a TV set was<br />
  mounted, but luckily it was turned off. There were few other<br />
  customers in the place, but, of course, business was always kind of<br />
  slow in the middle of the day. They seated themselves at the bar.<br />
  They bartender, a portly, balding man smoking a cigar, came up<br />
  to them. &quot;What'll you have?&quot;<br />
  &quot;What kind of beer you got?&quot; The Fly wanted to know.<br />
  &quot;Deer.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Deer?&quot; The Fly was puzzled.<br />
  &quot;Deer Beer,&quot; the bartender stated matter-of-factly. &quot;This is<br />
  the Deer Bar, we got Deer Beer. You want it or not?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Uh, yeah, okay,&quot; the Fly replied, somewhat confused. &quot;Uh,<br />
  three Deer Beers.&quot;<br />
  Ernie looked at the Fly. It occurred to him that no-one around<br />
  here seemed at all disturbed by the Fly's looks. That seemed to a<br />
  bit odd. He would have expected the Fly to have attracted somewhat<br />
  more attention.  But then on the other hand, Ernie thought, it<br />
  probably didn't mean anything. After all, everything is pretty<br />
  strange around here. Ernie appreciated the opportunity to relax and<br />
  have a beer.<br />
  The Fly pointed into the darkness at the far end of the bar.<br />
  &quot;Hey, get a load of that babe!&quot; he said to Ernie, his antennae<br />
  waving excitedly. <br />
  Ernie peered intently. He could just barely see, in the dim<br />
  light, a rather disreputable-looking young woman with bleached<br />
  blond hair and a skimpy outfit, perched on a stool at the far end<br />
  of the bar.<br />
  &quot;What's your name, dear?&quot; The Fly called out to her.<br />
  &quot;Bambi,&quot; she replied.<br />
  The Fly was encouraged. &quot;Hey, whaddya say we...&quot;<br />
  &quot;Cost you bucks,&quot; she interrupted.<br />
  The Fly's antennae drooped dispiritedly. &quot;How come there<br />
  aren't any nice girls around anymore?&quot; He turned back to his beer.<br />
  Sterno looked about worriedly. He sniffed. &quot;Something smells<br />
  very peculiar around here.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Probably just onions.&quot; Ernie was unconcerned. <br />
  &quot;Hardly!&quot; sniffed Sterno. &quot;There is something seriously wrong<br />
  about this place!&quot;<br />
  &quot;NOW who's paranoid?&quot; Ernie dismissed Sterno's fears.<br />
  Just then the door to the bar opened, and a woman walked in.<br />
  She had flaming red hair, and was wearing a 1950's-style party<br />
  dress. &quot;Hi, there, fellas!&quot; she said loudly.<br />
  &quot;HI!&quot; The Fly jumped up, his antennae waving excitedly. &quot;Say,<br />
  can I buy you a drink?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Sure!&quot; she answered in a brassy voice. Ernie looked at the<br />
  woman. Not my type, he thought. Too loud. He looked at her again.<br />
  Something about her seemed very familiar. Ernie was sure he had<br />
  seen her before, but he couldn't quite remember where.<br />
  &quot;Gee!&quot; she said to the Fly. &quot;You sure are different-looking!<br />
  Where are you from?&quot;<br />
  The Fly thought quickly. &quot;Uh..France!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, sure, I know France!&quot; the woman answered brightly. &quot;Ooh-<br />
  la-la, c'est-la-vie, Eiffel Tower, right?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Sure, you got it!&quot; The Fly whispered aside to the others. &quot;Oh<br />
  boy, oh boy, I'm really getting somewhere now!&quot; He turned back to<br />
  the woman. &quot;So, like, what's your name?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Lucy,&quot; she answered loudly. The door opened again, and a<br />
  swarthy man with slicked-back black hair entered. He was wearing a<br />
  Cuban shirt with huge ruffled sleeves, and carrying a pair of<br />
  maracas. The woman gestured towards the man. &quot;And this is my<br />
  husband, Ricky.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Aww...&quot; the Fly's antennae drooped.<br />
  &quot;How you do!&quot; said the man, with a heavy Spanish accent. &quot;I'm<br />
  Ricky Ricardo, de famous Cuban bandleader.&quot; He shook his maracas<br />
  rhythmically. &quot;Chick-a-boom, chick-a-boom.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Yeah. Hi.&quot; the Fly answered glumly. He turned to the others.<br />
  &quot;Wouldn't you know, she's married.&quot; He was obviously deeply<br />
  disappointed. He brightened a bit. &quot;Say,&quot; he said to Lucy. &quot;You<br />
  wouldn't happen to have any girlfriends you could ask over, do<br />
  you?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Friends?&quot; said Lucy shrilly. &quot;Sure, I got friends. In fact,<br />
  a couple of them are on there way over right now!&quot;<br />
  The Fly was thrilled. &quot;Oh boy, oh boy!&quot; His antennae waved<br />
  excitedly. He turned to Ricky. &quot;Hey, I like the shirt, guy! It's<br />
  the new `in' thing, right?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Chure!&quot; Ricky agreed. &quot;Ees de latest style in Habana!&quot;<br />
  The door opened, and in walked an older couple, also dressed<br />
  in 1950's styles. &quot;Oh,&quot; said Lucy. &quot;Here's my friends now. Fellas,<br />
  this is Fred and Ethel Mertz.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Aww.&quot; The Fly was disappointed. These weren't the type of<br />
  friends he had been hoping for.<br />
  Sterno leaned forward. &quot;There is something terribly wrong with<br />
  these people,&quot; he said to Ernie and the Captain. &quot;I can smell it.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Leave me alone,&quot; said Ernie. He hadn't forgiven Sterno for<br />
  blaming the bank problem on him.<br />
  All these people looked terribly familiar to Ernie. Suddenly,<br />
  he had it!<br />
  &quot;I've got it!&quot; he shouted.<br />
  The Fly was more mystified than ever. &quot;Now HE'S got it? What<br />
  is it, contagious?&quot; He edged away from Ernie slightly.<br />
  &quot;No, not THAT!&quot; said Ernie impatiently. &quot;I just<br />
  remembered...it's `I Love Lucy'!&quot;<br />
  Lucy put her hand on Ernie's arm. &quot;I love you, too.&quot; She said.<br />
  She edged closer. &quot;Now that we're friends, I'd like to ask you a<br />
  little favor.&quot;<br />
  &quot;What?&quot; asked Ernie suspiciously. <br />
  &quot;It's just a little thing...&quot; she began hesitantly.<br />
  &quot;What?&quot; He edged away uncomfortably.<br />
  &quot;We'd just like to borrow it, just for a little while. We'll<br />
  bring it right back...&quot;<br />
  &quot;What?!&quot; Ernie was getting impatient.<br />
  &quot;Um,&quot; Lucy seemed a bit embarrassed. &quot;We'd like to borrow your<br />
  brain.&quot;<br />
  &quot;MY BRAIN!&quot; shrieked Ernie.<br />
  &quot;We just want to borrow it,&quot; said Lucy quickly. &quot;Just for a<br />
  little while. We're not going to steal it!&quot; Lucy laughed nervously.<br />
  &quot;NO!&quot; Ernie cried.<br />
  &quot;Really, you don't have anything to worry about!&quot; Lucy<br />
  continued. &quot;We're not going to take it back to our home planet, or<br />
  anything! And we're certainly not going to put it into a giant<br />
  killer robot and use it to take over the Earth!&quot; She laughed. &quot;We<br />
  would never do that!&quot; She turned to Ricky and the Mertz's. &quot;Would<br />
  we?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, no,&quot; they all laughed. &quot;We'd never do that! Never!&quot;<br />
  &quot;There, that proves it!&quot; Lucy concluded. &quot;So, how about it?&quot;<br />
  She reached towards Ernie's head.<br />
  &quot;NO!&quot; Ernie screamed, leaping off the bar stool. &quot;Keep your<br />
  hands off my brain!&quot; He whipped out his plastic broadsword and<br />
  brandished it menacingly.<br />
  After standing there a few moments, Ernie became aware of<br />
  everyone looking at him very peculiarly.<br />
  &quot;Hey, guy,&quot; the Fly inquired. &quot;Like, what are you gonna do<br />
  with that plastic sword?&quot;<br />
  Ernie could hear the sound of muffled laughter, but he<br />
  couldn't tell where it was coming from. Ernie glowered. &quot;Okay,<br />
  okay,&quot; he said, replacing the sword in it's sheath. &quot;Just keep your<br />
  hands off my brain, all right?&quot;<br />
  Lucy frowned. She looked at Sterno, and then looked at her<br />
  companions. &quot;Dog brain?&quot; she asked them. They all shook their<br />
  heads, no. She looked at the Fly. &quot;Fly brain?&quot; she asked Ricky and<br />
  the Mertz's. &quot;Nope.&quot; They shook their heads. She looked at Captain<br />
  Memory. She smiled broadly. &quot;I wonder if I could ask you a<br />
  favor...&quot;she began.<br />
  &quot;No chance!&quot; Captain Memory cut her off.<br />
  Her expression became ugly. Extremely ugly. In fact, thought<br />
  Ernie, she was changing into just about the ugliest thing Ernie had<br />
  ever seen. Lucy snarled, revealing rows of pointed, reptilian-<br />
  looking teeth and a forked tongue.<br />
  &quot;Foolish Earth creatures!&quot; she hissed, pulling out a<br />
  frightening-looking weapon. &quot;You will turn your brains over to us,<br />
  or we will destroy this miserable planet of yours!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Who ARE these people?&quot; Ernie whispered to Captain Memory.<br />
  &quot;Remember I told you about those aliens?&quot; Captain Memory<br />
  asked. Ernie nodded. &quot;Well, here they are!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Hey, guys, what do we do now?&quot; the Fly asked Ernie and<br />
  Captain Memory, looking at Lucy's weapon uneasily.<br />
  Captain Memory looked up brightly. &quot;Hey,&quot; he said to Lucy and<br />
  her companions. &quot;Wanna watch some TV?&quot;<br />
  Lucy and the other aliens were totally confused. &quot;Watch TV? I<br />
  don't remember that! Is that in the script? What are we supposed to<br />
  do?&quot; They looked at each other confusedly.<br />
  &quot;Oh, wow, look what's on!&quot; Before anyone could stop him,<br />
  Captain Memory had reached behind the bar and turned on the TV.<br />
  &quot;It's time for `Wheel of Torture!'&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> CHAPTER 4</p>
<p> An image of Sturmbannfuhrer Dr. Heinz von Liederkranz filled<br />
  the screen. &quot;Vis us tonight,&quot; he began. &quot;Ve haff our contestants<br />
  from our last show.&quot; He turned to introduce them. &quot;First, Captain<br />
  Memory!&quot; Captain Memory bowed, to polite applause from the<br />
  audience. &quot;Goombah de Barbarian!&quot; Ernie blinked and staggered. Once<br />
  again, he suddenly found himself on the game show stage. His<br />
  stomach flipped over once again. He hated these abrupt changes of<br />
  scene. &quot;Not again,&quot; he moaned.<br />
  Captain Memory shrugged. &quot;Hey, that's show biz!&quot;<br />
  The audience was staring at Ernie. They seemed to be expecting<br />
  something. He smiled and waved half-heartedly. The audience<br />
  tittered and applauded weakly. Ernie noticed that the audience was<br />
  still made up entirely of Nazis.<br />
  He sighed. He might have known he would wind up back here, he<br />
  thought. Whatever the worst thing is that could possibly happen,<br />
  that's what will happen. Ernie frowned. In fact, this was even the<br />
  worst thing that couldn't possibly happen, and it was happening<br />
  anyway! Wasn't that against Murphy's Law, or something? Anyway, it<br />
  was all very confusing.<br />
  Von Liederkranz turned to the other side of the stage. Ernie<br />
  noticed that the aliens had been transported onto the game show as<br />
  well, and were now staggering and blinking, just like Ernie.<br />
  &quot;Und tonight, ve have vith us special guests,&quot; von Liederkranz<br />
  said, gesturing towards the aliens with his riding crop. &quot;Lucy and<br />
  Ricky Ricardo, the famous Cuban bandleader, and their friends, Fred<br />
  and Ethel Mertz.&quot; Thunderous applause greeted the introduction.<br />
  The aliens were utterly confused. &quot;Chick-a-boom?&quot; asked Ricky,<br />
  shaking his maracas feebly. The Mertz's drew alien weapons,<br />
  pointing them in all directions uncertainly.<br />
  &quot;Und now, ze big question,&quot; von Liederkranz said to the<br />
  aliens. &quot;Vill you take vot's in dis bag,&quot; he held up a small paper<br />
  bag, which looked a lot like somebody's lunch. &quot;Or try for vot's<br />
  behind door number four!&quot;<br />
  The audience was hushed with anticipation. The aliens looked<br />
  at each other in confusion. &quot;What do we do? I wasn't prepared for<br />
  this! I don't know what to do!&quot; they told each other.<br />
  Captain Memory decided to help them out. &quot;Anyone with any<br />
  BRAINS would take what's behind door number four!&quot; he hinted.<br />
  The aliens brightened. &quot;Brains! Brains! Yes, that's it! Let's<br />
  take what's behind door number four!&quot; They looked pleased. &quot;Chick-<br />
  a-BOOM!&quot; said Ricky definitely.<br />
  &quot;Door number four it is!&quot; called out von Liederkranz. The<br />
  audience roared it's approval.<br />
  An attractive woman in a chorus-girl outfit opened door number<br />
  four, and the aliens filed in, looking very pleased. As soon as the<br />
  last alien was inside, the door slammed with a metallic crash. The<br />
  chorus girl reached over and daintily locked it.<br />
  Immediately, Ernie began to hear the sounds of commotion<br />
  coming from behind the door. At first, pounding, then thuds, then<br />
  shrill, blood-curdling screams. The screams continued for several<br />
  minutes, and then died away. Finally, all was silent behind door<br />
  number four.<br />
  The audience applauded. &quot;Vell,&quot; von Liederkranz announced<br />
  jovially. &quot;Looks like dey got vot dey had coming to dem, doesn't<br />
  it?&quot; He laughed. He turned to Ernie, Captain Memory, and the<br />
  others. Ernie noticed that, while their attention had been drawn<br />
  elsewhere, guards with machine guns had surrounded them. &quot;Shtill,<br />
  it vas very considerate of dem to find you for me,&quot; he said, with<br />
  an evil gleam in his eye. &quot;I vas afraid ve had lost you forever<br />
  after dat unfortunate incident vit de alien Blaster.&quot; Von<br />
  Liederkranz turned to the guard nearest him. &quot;...for vhich YOU vill<br />
  pay, schweinhund!&quot; He lashed the guard with his riding crop.<br />
  &quot;But, Herr Doktor,&quot; the guard protested. &quot;I vasn't even<br />
  there!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Shut up!&quot; von Liederkranz snapped. He turned to Captain<br />
  Memory. &quot;Und now, perhaps ve vill continue vith ze questions, ja?&quot;<br />
  He smiled sadistically. &quot;You remember vhere ve left off? Vis ze Hot<br />
  Vhirling Corkscrew?&quot; <br />
  A guard handed von Liederkranz the by-now-familiar diabolical-<br />
  looking device, which began to glow and whirl. Von Liederkranz<br />
  smiled evilly. He began slowly advancing toward Captain Memory with<br />
  his device.<br />
  Von Liederkranz was disturbed by the sound of a knock. He<br />
  looked around. There it was again; someone was knocking on the<br />
  stage door. Von Liederkranz was annoyed. &quot;Answer ze door,<br />
  dummkopf!&quot; he snapped at one of the guards. The guard opened the<br />
  door.<br />
  &quot;Mailman!&quot; A fellow in a post office uniform walked in the<br />
  door. &quot;Got a special delivery letter here!&quot;<br />
  Von Liederkranz narrowed his eyes suspiciously. &quot;For who?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Is there a `Mr. Ernest Ross' here?&quot; <br />
  &quot;Uh, that's me,&quot; Ernie said.<br />
  &quot;Here you go!&quot; The mailman handed Ernie a letter.<br />
  Everything stopped while Ernie opened the letter. Von<br />
  Liederkranz and the Nazis milled about confusedly.<br />
  Ernie was totally mystified. Who could be sending him a<br />
  letter, here? Nobody knew he was here, and even if they did, why<br />
  would they send him a letter here? Ernie tore the letter open and<br />
  read.</p>
<p> &quot;Dear Mr. Ross,<br />
  We still have not received payment on your outstanding<br />
  balance of  $195,412,771,213,312,032.29. This account is now two<br />
  billion years overdue. Do not force us to turn this matter over to<br />
  a collection agency. Send in your payment immediately, before we<br />
  are required to take further action.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>First National Bank of the West</p>
<p>P.S. If you have already sent in your payment, please disregard<br />
  this notice.&quot;<br />
  Ernie looked up. Von Liederkranz was watching him very<br />
  carefully. Ernie had an idea. &quot;Oops, looks like I gotta go pay a<br />
  bill! See ya!&quot; Ernie started towards the door.<br />
  &quot;Not so fast!&quot; Von Liederkranz blocked Ernie's path. &quot;Give me<br />
  dot letter!&quot; He snatched it out of Ernie's hand.<br />
  Der Sturmbannfuhrer was very upset. How dare they interrupt<br />
  his game show to deliver a letter! And just exactly who was this<br />
  message from, anyway? And what did it really mean?<br />
  Von Liederkranz examined the letter carefully. &quot;Zo,&quot; he said<br />
  thoughtfully. &quot;You owe ze bank one hundred and ninety-five<br />
  quadrillion dollars. Just as we thought!&quot; Of course, it wasn't<br />
  really what he thought at all.<br />
  The Nazi's eyes narrowed. &quot;Zis one hundred and ninety-five<br />
  quadrillion dollars, it is a great deal of money, ja?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Ja. I mean, yes,&quot; agreed Ernie.<br />
  &quot;It is more, even, than I make in a veek!&quot; Von Liederkranz<br />
  eyed Ernie suspiciously. &quot;Zo, how is it dot you come to owe zo much<br />
  money?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well, you see, there was this problem with cigar butts two<br />
  billion years ago,&quot; Ernie explained nervously. He didn't like the<br />
  Nazi's tone of voice, and he particularly didn't like the Hot<br />
  Whirling Corkscrew. &quot;And then, we were at the bank, and I had to go<br />
  and open my big mouth, and so then...&quot;<br />
  &quot;SCHWEINHUND!&quot; Von Liederkranz whipped Ernie with the letter.<br />
  &quot;Do you take me for a fool!? No-one could possibly owe zis much<br />
  money! Obviously, zis is some sort of secret code. Now, who vould<br />
  be sending you secret coded messages HERE, on mein own game show!?&quot;<br />
  Ernie looked pleadingly at Captain Memory; the Captain just<br />
  shrugged.<br />
  Von Liederkranz continued reflectively. &quot;Und how could zey<br />
  know vhere to find you vis zis message, unless...&quot; He whirled to<br />
  face his guards. &quot;One of YOU is a traitor!!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Nein! Nein!&quot; The guards blanched and backed away. Von<br />
  Liederkranz looked at the audience. &quot;Or perhaps, one of YOU!&quot;<br />
  &quot;NEIN! NEIN!&quot; the audience cried out in unison, fidgeting<br />
  uncomfortably in their seats.<br />
  Von Liederkranz advanced on the audience, the Hot Whirling<br />
  Corkscrew spinning and glowing in his hand. &quot;Zo, you vill not<br />
  confess, eh!?&quot; he shrieked at the audience. &quot;Perhaps a taste of the<br />
  Corkscrew vill loosen your tongues!&quot;<br />
  Ernie felt a tap on his shoulder. Captain Memory beckoned<br />
  towards the back of the stage. All eyes were riveted on von<br />
  Liederkranz, and on the hissing, spinning torture device in his<br />
  hand. No-one was paying any attention to the foursome. They tiptoed<br />
  into the wings and back behind the stage. As they left, they began<br />
  to hear screams coming from somewhere in the audience.<br />
  They hurried along the corridor leading to the dressing rooms<br />
  backstage. Unfortunately, there seemed to be no exits anywhere in<br />
  that part of the building. The only exits were through the main<br />
  floor, which would have required them to go back out onto the<br />
  stage. This did not seem like a very good idea. An empty dressing<br />
  room beckoned ahead of them. They hurried into it and locked the<br />
  door behind them. The screams were still audible inside the room.<br />
  &quot;Hey, guys,&quot; the Fly wanted to know. &quot;Like, what are we gonna<br />
  do now?&quot;<br />
  Ernie sneezed. &quot;I wish they wouldn't keep the air conditioning<br />
  turned up so high,&quot; he complained, shivering.<br />
  &quot;Well, if you're going to go around wearing  nothing but that<br />
  ridiculous fur loincloth, you have to expect to get a chill,&quot;<br />
  commented Sterno unsympathetically. &quot; We'd all feel a lot better if<br />
  you'd cover up some of that pallid skin of yours.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Hey, that's an idea!&quot; the Fly chimed in. &quot;This is a dressing<br />
  room! Maybe there's some clothes here you can wear!&quot;<br />
  That seemed like a good idea to Ernie. He'd been uncomfortably<br />
  cold ever since he'd put that silly loincloth on. He began looking<br />
  through the closet, but found only filmy negligees and harem-girl<br />
  outfits.<br />
  &quot;Hey, there's a whole wardrobe room next door,&quot; the Fly<br />
  pointed to an adjoining room. &quot;Take a look in there!&quot; Ernie<br />
  disappeared into the next room.<br />
  Sterno was searching the room carefully. &quot;What'cha looking<br />
  for, secret passages?&quot; the Fly asked eagerly.<br />
  &quot;Actually, I was rather hoping someone might have left a spot<br />
  of brandy about,&quot; he answered. &quot;Aha!&quot; He pulled out a bottle. A<br />
  look of disappointment appeared on his face. &quot;MD 20/20?&quot; he asked.<br />
  &quot;What in the world could that be?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, wow,&quot; commented the Fly. &quot;Mad Dog!&quot;<br />
  &quot;I beg your pardon!&quot; snapped Sterno huffily.<br />
  &quot;Hey, no offense!&quot; said the Fly quickly. &quot;That's just what<br />
  it's called, you know?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Hmmph!&quot; Sterno opened the bottle and sniffed the contents.<br />
  &quot;Dreadful!&quot; he proclaimed, and dropped the bottle in the trash.<br />
  Ernie reappeared from the wardrobe room. He was now clad in a<br />
  Spanish toreador outfit, consisting of a scintillating gold suit,<br />
  covered with sequins, with knee breeches and white stockings, a<br />
  white shirt and tie, and an odd-shaped little black hat.<br />
  He noticed everyone looking at him oddly. &quot;Hey, it was the<br />
  only thing I could find, you know? Ernie said defensively. &quot;At<br />
  least it's warm!&quot;<br />
  Sterno sniffed. &quot;I must say, you have the most AWFUL taste in<br />
  clothes! But, at least it's better than looking at that sickening<br />
  body of yours!&quot;<br />
  Ernie was offended. &quot;What's wrong with my body?&quot;<br />
  Sterno rolled his eyes upward silently.<br />
  Only the Fly seemed to approve of Ernie's new outfit. &quot;Hey,<br />
  guy,&quot; he said enthusiastically. &quot;I like the suit! It's the new `in'<br />
  thing, right?&quot;<br />
  Sterno regarded Ernie critically. &quot;Why are you still carrying<br />
  that ridiculous plastic broadsword?&quot;<br />
  Ernie shifted uncomfortably. &quot;Hey, I told you, it's a forty<br />
  buck deposit!&quot;<br />
  Sterno rolled his eyes upward. &quot;Hopeless!&quot;<br />
  Ernie sat down in a comfortable-looking chair. He thought he<br />
  had better take advantage of every opportunity to rest; he had no<br />
  way of knowing how long all of this craziness was going to<br />
  continue.<br />
  &quot;So, like, what's with that Lucy chick?&quot; the Fly asked Captain<br />
  Memory. &quot;I mean, like, what's her problem?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, she's an alien,&quot; explained the Captain.<br />
  &quot;A what?&quot;<br />
  &quot;You know,&quot; the Captain went on. &quot;Come from outer space,<br />
  invade the Earth, steal your brain, that kinda stuff.&quot; The Captain<br />
  made himself comfortable on a small sofa, and began leafing through<br />
  his copy of the TV Guide.<br />
  &quot;Aliens?&quot; Ernie asked confusedly. &quot;Are they really aliens?&quot;<br />
  &quot;There as real as anything in Cyberspace, I suppose,&quot; the<br />
  Captain commented.<br />
  &quot;But what are they DOING here?&quot; Ernie wanted to know.<br />
  &quot;They're part of a game called `MENACE FROM PLANET ZERO'. It's<br />
  quite popular,&quot; the Captain explained. &quot;I figured we'd run across<br />
  it sooner or later. With all the systems Waldo's been taking over,<br />
  the odds are that it'd be in at least one of them.&quot;<br />
  The Fly seemed a bit skeptical. &quot;Well, gee, that chick sure<br />
  didn't look like an alien!&quot;<br />
  The Captain was impatient. &quot;She's in disguise, of course! You<br />
  wouldn't want to see what she really looks like!&quot; He shuddered.<br />
  &quot;Anyway,&quot; he continued. &quot;That whole bunch are aliens in disguise.<br />
  They've been watching our 1950's TV shows, and they think those TV<br />
  characters are normal Earth people. They think if they disguise<br />
  themselves as 1950's TV characters, you Earth people will never<br />
  know the difference.&quot;<br />
  &quot;They don't seem to be very smart,&quot; Ernie commented.<br />
  &quot;Well, you know,&quot; said the Captain thoughtfully. &quot;Intelligence<br />
  is not the only way to approach reality. There are other ways of<br />
  thinking. It's possible to approach problem-solving from an<br />
  entirely different perspective. There are civilizations in which<br />
  thinking is done in an entirely different way, where `intelligence'<br />
  is replaced by a whole different way of looking at the universe!&quot;<br />
  Ernie had never heard Captain Memory get so philosophical<br />
  before. &quot;So, do these aliens have a completely different way of<br />
  thinking?&quot; he asked wonderingly.<br />
  &quot;No,&quot; said the Captain reflectively. &quot;They're just stupid.&quot;<br />
  He returned to his TV Guide.<br />
  &quot;I mighta known,&quot; said the Fly reflectively. &quot;After all, she's<br />
  hanging out with that Ricky guy! Man, he's something else! Anybody<br />
  who'd wear a shirt like that...&quot; He trailed off, looking sideways<br />
  at Ernie.<br />
  A number of magazines were scattered about an end table next<br />
  to Ernie's chair. A headline in one of the caught Ernie's eye:<br />
  &quot;FANTASTIC ARCHAEOLOGICAL FIND REVEALED!&quot; Ernie picked it up and<br />
  began to read:<br />
  &quot;On October 16, 1978, an Arab shepherd following a stray<br />
  animal into a cave near the Sea of Galilee made an incredible find<br />
  - a find unparalleled in modern history. A find so monumental, so<br />
  earth-shattering, so threatening to world governments and religious<br />
  institutions that its very existence has been suppressed. Only now,<br />
  by means of smuggled documents obtained at great personal risk to<br />
  all involved, can this fabulous story come to light  - the story of<br />
  the Dead Sea Phonograph Records!&quot;<br />
  Ernie was intrigued. He read on:<br />
  &quot;Our story must really begin in Ancient Egypt - deep in the<br />
  mysteries of the Middle Kingdom; an age which produced some of the<br />
  greatest wonders the world has even seen. Some of these, like the<br />
  Pyramids, have been known to the world for millennia. Yet it stands<br />
  to reason that any people capable of producing wonders like these,<br />
  wonders which the modern world has yet to equal, must also have<br />
  been capable of producing many other amazing things on a smaller<br />
  scale. Yet, all of these have been lost in the sands of time - or<br />
  have they?<br />
  Let us consider for a moment the phonograph - a relatively<br />
  simple device invented in the last century by Thomas Edison. In its<br />
  basic form it consists of a disc, or even a cylinder, driven by a<br />
  crank, that comes in contact with a needle attached to a cone. One<br />
  can then either play or record simply by turning the crank and<br />
  either speaking into the cone, or listening. That's all there is to<br />
  it. A simple device like this can be made with almost anyone with<br />
  basic tools. It could have been made thousands of years ago - it<br />
  could even have been made by the ancient Egyptians! Certainly, any<br />
  civilization capable of producing incredible engineering feats like<br />
  the Pyramids would be capable of constructing a simple mechanical<br />
  device like this!<br />
  Now there is evidence that they did! In the tomb of the<br />
  Pharaoh Pepto II at Bismol, hieroglyphics have been found which<br />
  bear an uncanny resemblance to Edison's early phonographs. Along<br />
  with these were others which were translated to read &quot;...and the<br />
  voice of the Pharaoh shall speak on after he is gone<br />
  and...(fragment missing)...that we, who are as dogs to the mighty<br />
  Pharaoh, shall listen to Our Master's Voice!&quot;<br />
  Ernie looked at the accompanying illustration. It was a<br />
  picture from an Egyptian tomb, showing a dog listening to some kind<br />
  of a device with a cone coming out of it. It reminded Ernie of<br />
  something. Didn't it look a lot like...the RCA Victor logo? Then<br />
  again, maybe not. He continued reading.<br />
  &quot;But this is only the beginning! It would be monumental enough<br />
  if records of the voices of the Pharaohs had been found, but what<br />
  has actually been discovered is so spectacular as to make the<br />
  Pharaohs seem trivial by comparison. It was, of course, phonograph<br />
  records that the Arab shepherd found. They were in the form of<br />
  discs made of fine clay, a material much more durable than the<br />
  perishable vinyl that our present-day phonograph records are made<br />
  of, and were packed in the crumbling remains of an Egyptian-style<br />
  case. When played at approximately 78 rpm, they produced voices,<br />
  much like our own early phonograph records.<br />
  But - stop and consider. These records were found deep in<br />
  Israel, near the Sea of Galilee - in other words, nowhere near the<br />
  Egypt of the Pharaohs. There is no evidence that the phonograph was<br />
  ever used in ancient Israel; what's more, they were in an Egyptian-<br />
  style case, and bore Egyptian markings. How could they have come to<br />
  a cave near the Sea of Galilee?<br />
  There is only one way: They must have been brought there, from<br />
  Egypt - by the fleeing Israelites! Hieroglyphics prove that the<br />
  phonograph was in existence at this time; what would have been more<br />
  reasonable than for the fleeing Israelites, taking with them the<br />
  treasures of Egypt, to take with them this great treasure?<br />
  But what would they have used it for? What else but for the<br />
  same use as the Pharaohs, to record and preserve the voice of their<br />
  leader, so that his will can be known forever - the voice of Moses!<br />
  Yet, if this device, the phonograph, was in the hands of<br />
  Moses, wouldn't he have used it to record the things he considered<br />
  of greatest importance? In that case, wouldn't he have taken it to<br />
  Mount Sinai? Wouldn't he have used it to record - the voice of God<br />
  Himself?<br />
  Now you can see why this find has been suppressed - why no<br />
  government, no religious institution on Earth can afford to let<br />
  these records be heard. They contain at the very least the voice of<br />
  Moses, and possibly even the very voice of God. There may be things<br />
  on these records which could change the life of every man, woman,<br />
  and child on Earth - now, today, in the 20th century.<br />
  But will these records ever be heard? Or will they be hidden<br />
  away in a secret vault, kept from a world that needs them so<br />
  desperately?<br />
  They must be heard! The people have a right to this knowledge,<br />
  knowledge which affects each and every one of them in every facet<br />
  of their daily lives. Right now there is no way of knowing where<br />
  they are being held, or by whom, or for what purpose. But a find<br />
  like this CANNOT be suppressed. It is to earth-shaking, too<br />
  monumental. Word WILL leak out, people WILL be told! Already this<br />
  has begun to happen - secret documents have been smuggled out;<br />
  incontrovertible evidence has been uncovered. It is beginning - now<br />
  it is only a mater of time before the world learns the awesome<br />
  truth about the Dead Sea Phonograph Records!&quot;<br />
</p>
<p> Ernie put the magazine down. Wow, he thought. This is really<br />
  heavy. Is this for real, or is this just more crazy nonsense? Did<br />
  this really happen, or is this just more garbage caused by sticking<br />
  together too many computer programs that don't belong together? How<br />
  can we tell the difference?<br />
  Ernie thought about the problem. This is an important<br />
  question, he decided. We may have stumbled onto something really<br />
  meaningful. Somebody ought to look into this. Somebody ought to<br />
  find out whether this is for real or not, because if it is real it<br />
  might be...really important! Ernie stopped. He hadn't the vaguest<br />
  idea how somebody would go about looking into a question like this.<br />
  Ernie looked at Captain Memory. &quot;Here, look at this article.&quot;<br />
  He handed the magazine to the Captain.<br />
  The Captain peered at the article. &quot;The Dead Sea Phonograph<br />
  Records? Get real!&quot; Captain Memory tossed the magazine over his<br />
  shoulder.<br />
  &quot;No, really!&quot; Ernie protested. &quot;This is important stuff! I<br />
  really think you should consider it! What if this really happened?<br />
  What if this is, like a secret CIA computer file or something? I<br />
  mean, stuff like that could be here, right? It's possible, isn't<br />
  it?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Aything's possible,&quot; the Captain admitted. &quot;But how likely is<br />
  it?&quot;<br />
  Ernie heard snickering coming from behind him. He turned.<br />
  Sterno had picked up the magazine, and was leafing through it.<br />
  &quot;You actually READ this stuff?&quot; laughed Sterno. &quot;Here's a good<br />
  article: `Princess Diana says, I'm Carrying Elvis's Baby'. Or, how<br />
  about `I Was Raped by Killer Lesbians from Outer Space'&quot;.<br />
  Ernie frowned. Something about that last headline sounded a<br />
  little familiar.<br />
  Sterno continued. &quot;Here another one: `Earth invaded by Aliens<br />
  Disguised as 1950's TV Characters'.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Hey, lemme see that!&quot; Ernie reached for the magazine,<br />
  convinced that they were onto something.<br />
  &quot;What trash!&quot; Sterno dropped the magazine in the wastebasket.<br />
  &quot;Hey!&quot; Ernie fished through the wastebasket, trying to<br />
  retrieve the magazine. &quot;Oh no, it's all covered with sticky wine!<br />
  The pages are all stuck together!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Wow, man,&quot; said the Fly wonderingly. &quot;That's really heavy<br />
  stuff. Imagine that: Princess Diana pregnant with Elvis's baby. I<br />
  never knew that!&quot;<br />
  Ernie was trying to separate the pages of the magazine, but<br />
  the Mad Dog wine had dissolved most of the ink, and he was only<br />
  succeeding in making a big mess. <br />
  &quot;Did you really think you were going to find the secrets of<br />
  the universe in that magazine?&quot; asked Sterno sarcastically.<br />
  &quot;I don't think you're going to get anywhere with that stuff,&quot;<br />
  added Captain Memory. &quot;I think you're barking up the wrong tree!&quot;<br />
  &quot;I suppose you think that's funny!&quot; Sterno snarled. <br />
  He regarded Ernie for a moment. &quot;You know, that little hat looks<br />
  really ridiculous!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Yeah, guy,&quot; the Fly chimed in. &quot;How come you're wearing that<br />
  Mickey Mouse hat?&quot;<br />
  &quot;It's not a Mickey Mouse hat, alright?&quot; said Ernie,<br />
  frustrated. &quot;It's part of the outfit. You're supposed to wear this<br />
  kind of a little hat. I dunno why, you're just supposed to!&quot; Ernie<br />
  sulked. &quot;Leave me alone!&quot;<br />
  Sterno chuckled. &quot;The only good thing about having him along,&quot;<br />
  he said, gesturing at Ernie. &quot;Is that he can always cheer me up. If<br />
  I didn't have him to laugh at, I don't know WHAT I'd do!&quot; Ernie<br />
  glowered.<br />
  The Fly was sitting at a dressing table, regarding himself in<br />
  the mirror. He kept examining various bottle of cosmetics, holding<br />
  each in turn up to his face, but he couldn't find any that matched<br />
  his shell tone.<br />
  &quot;My, what big eyes you have!&quot; quipped Sterno. &quot;How about some<br />
  eyeliner? Or maybe some mascara for your antenna?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Aw, c'mon guys,&quot; the Fly complained. &quot;Gimme a break, huh? I<br />
  was just looking for a little, like, bronzer, y'know? Y'think<br />
  bronzer would look good on me?&quot; His antennae waved hopefully.<br />
  Ernie was feeling irritable. He was tired of everyone picking<br />
  on him all the time. &quot;Why do you keep reading that TV Guide?&quot; he<br />
  snapped at Captain Memory.<br />
  &quot;So I can see what's on,&quot; answered the Captain reasonably.<br />
  &quot;How can you possibly tell what's on, when you don't even know<br />
  where we are? You're never gonna have the right listings for here,<br />
  wherever THIS is!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Sure I do,&quot; disagreed the Captain. &quot;I've got the listings for<br />
  everywhere.&quot;<br />
  &quot;How could you have that?&quot; Ernie was skeptical.<br />
  &quot;This is the Inter-Continuum Edition, with Multi-Galactic Sub-<br />
  Listings, for the week of May 3-Infinity,&quot; explained the Captain.<br />
  &quot;It's got the listings for all of Time and Space.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Lemme see that!&quot; Ernie snatched it rudely out of Captain<br />
  Memory's hand. &quot;Why, the pages are all blank!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Are you a subscriber?&quot; the Captain wanted to know, gently<br />
  taking the book back out of Ernie's hands.<br />
  &quot;Well, no,&quot; Ernie admitted.<br />
  &quot;Well, that's why you can't see it!&quot; <br />
  Ernie sighed. He guessed that made as much sense as anything<br />
  else.<br />
  CM examined the listings carefully. &quot;Wanna watch an old movie?<br />
  Here's a classic: `Mr. Blandings Builds his Dream Horse'.&quot;<br />
  Ernie frowned. &quot;You mean `House'.&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory was puzzled. &quot;Mr. House Builds his Dream<br />
  Horse'?&quot;<br />
  Ernie shook his head. &quot;No, no. It's supposed to be `Mr.<br />
  Blandings Builds his Dream House'.&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory peered at the TV Guide. &quot;It quite clearly says<br />
  here `Horse'.&quot;<br />
  &quot;That's ridiculous!&quot; Ernie insisted. &quot;You can't build a<br />
  horse!&quot;<br />
  &quot;That's right!&quot; the Fly chimed in. &quot;At least, not without a<br />
  permit!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Huh?&quot; Ernie was taken aback.<br />
  &quot;And an inspection!&quot; the Fly went on. &quot;I mean, you wouldn't<br />
  want to ride a horse that was built without a permit, and wasn't<br />
  inspected! It wouldn't be safe!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Uh...&quot; Something about this didn't sound right to Ernie.<br />
  The Fly continued with enthusiasm. &quot;I mean, like what if you<br />
  took this horse out on the freeway, you know, and you're cruisin'<br />
  along, doin' maybe 60, and all of a sudden - boom! A leg falls off!<br />
  Then what? Somebody could get hurt!&quot;<br />
  Ernie didn't know how to argue with this. &quot;Uh, I suppose<br />
  you're right.&quot; He fell silent.<br />
  Captain Memory broke the silence. &quot;Hey, here's a good show!<br />
  8:30 - `Follow the Yellow Brick Road'. The Fab Four stop for a<br />
  drink at The Deer Bar, and meet aliens disguised as 1950's TV<br />
  characters.' Starring Lucille Ball, Adam West, and Rin-Tin-Tin. How<br />
  about that?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Sounds okay to me,&quot; said the Fly agreeably.<br />
  Ernie looked around the room. &quot;There's no TV!&quot; he said<br />
  triumphantly.<br />
  &quot;Oh, there's always a TV!&quot; the Captain assured him.<br />
  &quot;Okay, where?&quot; Ernie demanded.<br />
  &quot;Hmm.&quot; Captain Memory looked around. He got up, walked over to<br />
  the dressing table, and peered into the mirror. &quot;Let's try this: <br />
  `Mirror, mirror, on the wall,<br />
  Ain't there no TV at all?'&quot;<br />
  The surface of the mirror dissolved, and an image of The Deer<br />
  Bar appeared in its place. Four characters were seated at the bar,<br />
  drinking beer.<br />
  &quot;So, what are we gonna do now, guys?&quot; asked the Fly, sipping<br />
  a beer through his long, flexible snout.<br />
  Ernie started, and looked about confusedly. They were suddenly<br />
  all back at The Deer Bar. His stomach flipped over again.<br />
  &quot;What...uh..how did we get back here?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Same way we got out,&quot; said Captain Memory, gesturing towards<br />
  the TV set. He looked momentarily confused. &quot;Either that, or maybe<br />
  we never really left at all. I forget which. Oh well, it doesn't<br />
  really matter.&quot;<br />
  Ernie looked up at the television above the bar, which now was<br />
  turned on. A sadistic Nazi talk show host was using a diabolical-<br />
  looking device to torture members of the audience. &quot;Uh, do you mind<br />
  if I turn that off?&quot; asked Ernie.<br />
  &quot;If you like,&quot; answered the Captain indifferently.<br />
  Ernie switched off the set, and breathed a sigh of relief. Now<br />
  they were safe. He frowned. Well, maybe they weren't safe, but they<br />
  were safER. He thought about it a moment. Well, maybe they weren't<br />
  really any safer, but turning the TV off made him feel better just<br />
  the same. That satisfied him, so he returned to his seat.<br />
  The Fly looked around. &quot;Like, we're the only ones here!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Uh huh,&quot; Ernie agreed.<br />
  &quot;So, what happened to, like, Ricky and Lucy?&quot;<br />
  As if in answer, the door to the bar flew open, and in<br />
  staggered Ricky, his ruffled Cuban shirt in rags, his maracas<br />
  broken. Close behind him was Lucy, her hair disarrayed, her party<br />
  dress torn and smeared with dirt.<br />
  &quot;You feelthy peeg!&quot; shrieked Ricky, enraged. &quot;You send us<br />
  behind door numero four! I keel you!&quot;<br />
  &quot;What did he say?&quot; the Fly asked confusedly. &quot;I can't<br />
  understand his accent at all!&quot;<br />
  &quot;I think he said he was going to `keel' us,&quot; Sterno<br />
  volunteered.<br />
  &quot;What's that?&quot; the Fly wanted to know. &quot;Something to do with<br />
  boats?&quot;<br />
  Ricky advanced on the foursome, holding his shattered maracas<br />
  menacingly. Ernie noticed that they seemed to have acquired very<br />
  sharp edges. &quot;I keel you, I cut your brain out!&quot; he threatened<br />
  Ernie.<br />
  &quot;Hey, he's starting up with that `brain' stuff again,&quot; Ernie<br />
  said to Captain Memory. &quot;What do we do?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Have a beer,&quot; said Captain Memory, sipping his Deer Beer.<br />
  &quot;That's easy for you to say! It's not your brain he's after!&quot;<br />
  Ernie looked at Ricky apprehensively.<br />
  &quot;Why don't you just let him have your brain?&quot; snickered<br />
  Sterno. &quot;You'll never miss it!&quot;<br />
  Ricky slowly staggered forward. Ernie noticed that Ricky was<br />
  getting much more, sort of, reptilian-looking. He seemed to have<br />
  acquired long, sharp teeth, and a forked tongue, which flitted in<br />
  and out of his mouth in a snake-like manner.<br />
  &quot;Hey uh, shouldn't we, uh, DO something?&quot; Ernie urged Captain<br />
  Memory.<br />
  The Captain looked annoyed. &quot;Oh, all right!&quot; He cleared his<br />
  throat. &quot;And now,&quot; he announced pompously. &quot;A word from our<br />
  sponsor!&quot;<br />
  Ricky froze. &quot;Oh, ees a commercial,&quot; he said to Lucy. &quot;We got<br />
  to wait!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well, I guess we'd better get going, fellas,&quot; Captain Memory<br />
  said to the other three. &quot;We've only got sixty seconds.&quot; He gulped<br />
  down the rest of his beer. &quot;I hate to drink beer in a hurry. It<br />
  upsets my stomach.&quot; He burped. He brushed past Ricky and Lucy, who<br />
  were frozen into a state of immobility, and led the group out the<br />
  door.<br />
  Once outside, Captain Memory checked his bare wrist. &quot;Hmm,<br />
  ten more seconds. I know, let's try this!&quot; The Captain led the<br />
  group around the side of the building, where they could not be seen<br />
  from the main door.<br />
  Fifteen seconds later, Ricky and Lucy burst out of the bar<br />
  door. &quot;Where dey go?!&quot; Ricky screamed. &quot;Dey not suppose' to move<br />
  during de commercial! Dey got to wait for de show to start again!&quot;<br />
  Ricky and Lucy looked quickly around, and then charged off down the<br />
  road in the direction of the bank.<br />
  The Fly peeked around the corner. &quot;Looks like they're gone.&quot;<br />
  Ernie frowned. &quot;Are these aliens really that stupid?&quot; he asked<br />
  the Captain.<br />
  &quot;I'm afraid so,&quot; Captain Memory replied.<br />
  Ernie frowned. Something about this didn't seem to make sense.<br />
  &quot;If they're so stupid, how come they've got interstellar travel,<br />
  and blasters, and stuff like that?&quot; he asked pointedly.<br />
  &quot;Well, you know, aliens have brother-in-laws, too,&quot; Captain<br />
  Memory explained.<br />
  &quot;Brothers-in-law,&quot; Sterno corrected.<br />
  &quot;Uh, right,&quot; the Captain went on. &quot;Uh, relatives. They have<br />
  relatives too. Everybody has relatives.&quot;<br />
  &quot;So?&quot; Ernie wanted to know.<br />
  Captain Memory sighed. &quot;Well, what do you do if your brother-<br />
  in-law needs a job, but he's not too, um, bright? I mean, you can't<br />
  leave him to starve, right? After all, he's married to your sister.<br />
  Okay, so maybe your sister doesn't have real good taste in men,<br />
  she's still your sister, right? And what about your nephews...&quot;<br />
  &quot;Get to the point!&quot; Sterno demanded impatiently.<br />
  &quot;Okay, okay,&quot; Captain Memory went on. &quot;Anyway, you've got to<br />
  get him a job, but you don't want to get him anything too, like,<br />
  visible, because you know he's going to screw it up, and you'll get<br />
  blamed. So you get him a job that pays good, but is, um, out of the<br />
  way. Like, for instance, `interstellar scout.' Sure, he'll screw it<br />
  up, but he's millions of light years away, who's gonna know?&quot;<br />
  Ernie looked crestfallen. &quot;I always thought they'd send, you<br />
  know, their `Top Guns', their `best and brightest' to attack us.<br />
  You're mean they send their screw-ups to invade our planet?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory shrugged. &quot;Well, you know, it's a bureaucracy.<br />
  This is the real universe. Life's like that.&quot; Ernie sighed.<br />
  Captain Memory looked at his bare wrist. &quot;Anyway, I think it's<br />
  time to get going.&quot; He headed off purposefully down the yellow<br />
  brick road, going in the opposite direction from that in which<br />
  Ricky and Lucy had gone. The group trailed along behind him.<br />
</p>
<p> CHAPTER 5<br />
</p>
<p> Ernie caught up to Captain Memory as the foursome headed down<br />
  the yellow brick road. &quot;So, where are we anyway?&quot; he wanted to<br />
  know.<br />
  The Captain looked around. &quot;Could be Kansas, I suppose,&quot; he<br />
  said thoughtfully.<br />
  &quot;You don't KNOW?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory shrugged. &quot;You can't expect me to keep track of<br />
  all these PLACES,&quot; he said annoyedly. &quot;Do you know how many PLACES<br />
  there are in Cyberspace? There's...there's...&quot; He hesitated<br />
  confusedly. &quot;Well, I don't know exactly how many, but there's a<br />
  whole lot of them!  And they keep changing all the time, too! I<br />
  mean, you can go someplace you know real well, you come back in a<br />
  few nanoseconds, and it's all different! It was bad enough before<br />
  Waldo Stadium starting networking all these systems that were never<br />
  meant to be networked. Now it's impossible!  So don't expect ME to<br />
  keep track of it! It isn't MY fault!&quot; He calmed down. &quot;Anyway,&quot; he<br />
  said, more composedly. &quot;I guess it could be Nebraska.&quot;<br />
  Ernie peered into the distance. &quot;What's all that smoke?&quot; He<br />
  pointed to a large cloud on the horizon.<br />
  The Fly looked searchingly into the distance. With his huge,<br />
  multi-faceted insect eyes, he could see more clearly than any<br />
  human. &quot;That's not smoke, that's dust,&quot; he explained. &quot;There's a<br />
  whole lot of trucks and cars and stuff heading this way. There's<br />
  enough to be an army of 'em.&quot; He peered into the distance. &quot;In<br />
  fact, it IS an army! They got tanks, and guns, and everything!&quot;<br />
  Ernie felt uneasy. &quot;So, whose army it is?&quot;<br />
  They Fly squinted. &quot;I can't tell; too much dust.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Maybe we should just get out of the way and let them go by,&quot;<br />
  Sterno suggested.<br />
  This seemed like an excellent idea to Ernie. They stepped off<br />
  the road, climbed over a picturesque split-rail fence, and made<br />
  their way into a cornfield, where they hid themselves among the<br />
  tall plants. Ernie noticed a scarecrow out in the middle of the<br />
  field. He thought about it for a moment, but then he decided to<br />
  just leave it alone.<br />
  In a few minutes the first vehicles of the military column<br />
  began to pass them. Ernie noticed that they were armored personnel<br />
  carriers, painted tan and grey. On the side of each was the<br />
  insignia of a palm tree with a swastika at the base. Ernie<br />
  recognized it from watching war movies on the late show. &quot;It's the<br />
  Afrika Korps!&quot; he whispered to Captain Memory. &quot;What would they be<br />
  doing in Kansas, or maybe Nebraska?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Aha,&quot; said Captain Memory quietly. &quot;So that's it - Rommel<br />
  must be advancing on Omaha! Therefore, it will be up to Prince<br />
  Eugene to stop the Turkish hordes at the gates of Vienna. In that<br />
  case, Colonel Jackson must be heading down the mighty Mississippi<br />
  at this very moment, taking a little bacon and a little beans, to<br />
  fight the bloody British at the town of New Orleans! That means,&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory looked at his wrist. &quot;It must be 1814!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh.&quot; Ernie no longer expected Captain Memory's explanations<br />
  to shed much light on things, although, thinking about it,<br />
  something about the last part of Captain Memory's explanation did<br />
  sound a little familiar. But then, on the other hand, everything<br />
  sounded a little familiar, but none of it actually made any sense.<br />
  Ernie decided to try again, even though he didn't have much<br />
  hope of success. &quot;So what's going on, anyway? Isn't this supposed<br />
  to be, like, the Wizard of Oz or something? I don't remember any<br />
  Nazi armies in the Wizard of Oz!&quot;<br />
  &quot;The Wizard of Oz?&quot; the Captain asked wonderingly. &quot;Whatever<br />
  gave you that idea?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well, gee..&quot; Ernie had thought it was obvious. &quot;There's this<br />
  yellow brick road, and the bank manager was kind of a witch, and<br />
  she had ruby slippers and...&quot; He trailed off.<br />
  &quot;So what?&quot; the Captain demanded.<br />
  &quot;Well...If this isn't the Wizard of Oz, where did all that<br />
  stuff come from?&quot;<br />
  The Captain was annoyed. &quot;Sure, some of this is from THE<br />
  WIZARD OF OZ. But some of it isn't. Some of it's from other games,<br />
  or computer models, or databases, or whatever happened to be in the<br />
  systems that Waldo's been taking over. And there's no way to tell<br />
  what'll pop out where, or when. Even Waldo can't keep track of it.<br />
  It's taking all his computing power just to keep the system halfway<br />
  organized, so it doesn't crash. You know how hard it is to keep a<br />
  FATAL ERROR from creeping into this stuff? It's only because he's<br />
  got a multiple-redundant neural-net system that he can keep this<br />
  stuff running at all!&quot;<br />
  Ernie moaned. He didn't like the sound of that FATAL ERROR<br />
  business.<br />
  &quot;One thing bothers me, though,&quot; the Captain continued,<br />
  watching the military vehicles go by. &quot;These Nazis. They're showing<br />
  up way too often. They may be somehow picking up our trail.&quot;<br />
  &quot;You mean Waldo Stadium knows where we are?&quot; Ernie cried<br />
  anxiously. &quot;He's zeroing in on us?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Could be,&quot; said the Captain thoughtfully. &quot;It doesn't seem<br />
  like they know exactly where we are, but it does seem like they<br />
  know we're around here somewhere. I wonder how they know that?&quot;<br />
  Ernie sighed again. He would have to remember not to ask for<br />
  explanations anymore. They just made things worse.<br />
  After a few minutes, the last of the military vehicles passed,<br />
  taking with it the last of the huge cloud of dust. Ernie coughed.<br />
  He and the others were all covered with a thick layer of dirt. He<br />
  looked at himself. All the sparkle was gone from his toreador suit.<br />
  Sterno shook himself vigorously, sending dust flying in all<br />
  directions. &quot;Hey, watch it!&quot; the Fly complained. &quot;That stuff gets<br />
  in my eyes, you know?&quot;<br />
  Ernie looked at Captain Memory. &quot;How come you're not covered<br />
  with dirt?&quot; he demanded.<br />
  &quot;Oh, it's the suit,&quot; Captain Memory explained, fingering his<br />
  comic-book-character outfit. &quot;It's got that dirt-repelling stuff;<br />
  you know, the kind you put in the dryer?&quot;<br />
  Ernie examined his toreador outfit. On the inside he found a<br />
  small tag. Just my luck, Ernie thought. `Dry Clean Only'.<br />
  They made their way back on to the road, and continued in the<br />
  same direction they had been heading before the convoy went by. A<br />
  light breeze sprang up, and carried away the worst of the dust.<br />
  After walking for a few minutes, Ernie noticed a house in the<br />
  distance. As they approached, Ernie could see that it was an<br />
  elaborate Victorian cottage, covered with gingerbread-style<br />
  ornamentation. &quot;Hey, let's stop in!&quot; the Fly suggested. &quot;Maybe we<br />
  can get a drink of water. All this dust is really buggin' me!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, it's `bugging' you?&quot; asked Sterno maliciously.<br />
  &quot;Yeah!&quot; the Fly answered ingenuously.<br />
  Sterno shrugged. There was no point in sniping at people who<br />
  were too dense to understand it.<br />
  As they neared the cottage, Ernie noticed that it was<br />
  surrounded by a white picket fence. However, a large section of the<br />
  fence had been knocked over. The lawn seemed to be all chewed up,<br />
  as though by the treads of a tank. Heading up the front walk, Ernie<br />
  noticed the door was broken off it's hinges. <br />
  As they climbed the porch, Ernie noticed that the gingerbread<br />
  on the cottage was - actual gingerbread, the edible kind. Ernie<br />
  broke off a piece and sniffed it. It seemed fresh. He took a bite.<br />
  Very tasty, he thought. He suddenly realized that he hadn't had<br />
  anything to eat for a really long time. The shutters looked<br />
  interesting - they had frosting and raisins.<br />
  &quot;Oh wow, what happened here?&quot; Ernie heard the Fly ask. He<br />
  looked through the door. Inside were obvious signs of a struggle.<br />
  The quaint, German-style furniture was scattered about. The walls<br />
  were pockmarked with bullet holes. On one side of the room was a<br />
  large, cast-iron stove. Next to the stove stood a large cage, with<br />
  its door open. The stove was red-hot, and a bad smell came from it.<br />
  Captain Memory considered the scene, and regarded the tank<br />
  tracks and bullet holes. &quot;Looks like whoever was here got arrested<br />
  by the Nazis,&quot; he commented.<br />
  Ernie thought about this. Hansel and Gretel arrested by the<br />
  Nazis? But then again, `Hansel and Gretel' is a German story, isn't<br />
  it? In that case, Ernie decided, it's none of my business. I won't<br />
  worry about it. Instead, he decided to look for something else to<br />
  eat.<br />
  Ernie found an old-fashioned icebox, which seemed to be full<br />
  of pies, cakes, and other goodies. There didn't seem to be anything<br />
  by way of regular, wholesome food, though. Oh well, thought Ernie,<br />
  cutting into a Bavarian Black Forest Torte, I guess I'll just have<br />
  to rough it.<br />
  Sterno was helping himself to an eclair. &quot;Very nice,&quot; he<br />
  commented. &quot;Would you mind handing me a piece of that double-<br />
  chocolate rum cheesecake?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Hey, this is good stuff!&quot; the Fly added, vacuuming up a dish<br />
  of frosted ginger snaps through his long snout.<br />
  Ernie stopped. &quot;Hey, how do we know this stuff is okay? I<br />
  mean, maybe this is an alien trap, or something. Maybe this stuff<br />
  is poisoned!&quot;<br />
  Sterno sniffed disgustedly. &quot;We can always count on you to say<br />
  something utterly inappropriate at the table, can't we? Comments<br />
  like that can ruin everyone's appetite. The first decent thing<br />
  we've had to eat on this entire ridiculous escapade, and you have<br />
  to go and spoil it!&quot;<br />
  Ernie was upset. &quot;Well, okay, maybe you're right. That's not<br />
  dinner-table conversation. But still, how do we know?&quot;<br />
  Sterno sighed. &quot;The problem with you is that you have no sense<br />
  of smell. I, for one, would have known if there was anything wrong<br />
  with these delectable little morsels.&quot;<br />
  Ernie relaxed. &quot;So, this place isn't an alien trap, or<br />
  anything?&quot; he asked Captain Memory.<br />
  &quot;Oh no, it's a trap alright,&quot; the Captain said unconcernedly,<br />
  helping himself to a dish of something with custard and cherries in<br />
  it.<br />
  &quot;WHAT?!&quot;<br />
  &quot;But the food's okay,&quot; the Captain continued. &quot;So we might as<br />
  well have some, don't you think?&quot; He helped himself to a coconut<br />
  cream pie.<br />
  Ernie suddenly felt very anxious. &quot;So, uh, where's the trap,<br />
  then?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, I don't know,&quot; the Captain went on. &quot;We'll find it,<br />
  though. We always do.&quot; He looked at Ernie's plate. &quot;Say, are you<br />
  gonna eat that Black Forest Torte? If you don't want it, I'll take<br />
  it!&quot;<br />
  Ernie seemed to have lost his appetite. &quot;Uh, here. Take it.&quot;<br />
  He handed the dish to Captain Memory. Ernie's stomach was beginning<br />
  to feel queasy again. Stress, he thought. It's not good for me. I'm<br />
  gonna get an ulcer. I just know it.<br />
  Ernie noticed an open door in the back of the cottage. It<br />
  seemed to lead to a bathroom. Maybe I can get cleaned up, Ernie<br />
  thought. The dust was beginning to make him itch.<br />
  Inside the door, Ernie found a nicely-appointed modern<br />
  bathroom, complete with soap and fresh towels. I'll bet I have time<br />
  for a quick shower, he thought. He turned on the shower and let the<br />
  water run for a bit. Nice and warm, he thought. Not too hot. Seems<br />
  okay. He took off his toreador suit, shaking the dust off each<br />
  piece in turn, and got in the shower.<br />
  Ernie let the warn water run over him. Well, this is much<br />
  better, he thought, relaxing. There was a bottle of shampoo on the<br />
  tub shelf. He picked it up and examined it. &quot;Placental Protein<br />
  Shampoo&quot;. Oh. That was the same kind of shampoo he used at home.<br />
  Maybe it would get the dust out of his hair. <br />
  &quot;Watch ouph phrm trmp...&quot; What? Was somebody talking to him?<br />
  Ernie couldn't hear over the sound of the shower. He stuck his head<br />
  out. &quot;Did you say something?&quot; he called towards the others.<br />
  &quot;Yes,&quot; answered Captain Memory. &quot;I said: `Watch out for the<br />
  trap!'&quot;<br />
  &quot;WHAT?!&quot; Ernie leaped out of the shower. He was about to run<br />
  into the next room, when suddenly it occurred to him that he was<br />
  stark naked and dripping wet. He decided to take a moment to grab<br />
  a towel and wrap it around himself; he wasn't prepared to face the<br />
  ridicule he would have gotten otherwise. &quot;What trap!? Where's the<br />
  trap?!&quot;<br />
  &quot;You're holding it,&quot; Captain Memory gestured at Ernie.<br />
  &quot;The TOWEL?!&quot; Ernie almost flung it away, but decided against<br />
  it.<br />
  &quot;No, your other hand!&quot; Ernie looked at his left hand. He was<br />
  still unconsciously clutching the bottle of shampoo. &quot;This? This<br />
  bottle of shampoo?&quot; Ernie examined it. &quot;What is it, a bomb or<br />
  something?&quot;<br />
  &quot;No, it's a bottle of shampoo,&quot; Captain Memory agreed.<br />
  &quot;So what's the big deal?&quot; Ernie felt a little foolish getting<br />
  all upset over a bottle of shampoo.<br />
  &quot;What kind of shampoo is it?&quot; Captain Memory prompted.<br />
  &quot;Placental Protein Shampoo? What's wrong with that?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Do you know what a placenta is?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Yeah. It's the thing that feeds an embryo in the womb.&quot; Ernie<br />
  had gotten an `A' in biology, and was proud of it.<br />
  &quot;Ever wonder what proteins from embryos are doing in your<br />
  shampoo?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Uh, now that you mention it, that does seem a little<br />
  strange,&quot; Ernie admitted.<br />
  &quot;Ever wonder `proteins from embryos of WHAT'?&quot; the Captain<br />
  prodded. &quot;Or, `what KIND of proteins'?&quot;<br />
  &quot;I don't like the sound of this,&quot; Ernie said quietly.<br />
  Captain Memory went on. &quot;DNA is a protein, you know.&quot;<br />
  Ernie thought a moment. &quot;You mean, DNA, like in genetic<br />
  material, like `basic building blocks of life', the stuff that<br />
  determines what every kind of life form is going to be?&quot;<br />
  &quot;That's right,&quot; the Captain agreed. &quot;Now, what do you suppose<br />
  would happen to you if you rubbed alien DNA from unborn space<br />
  creatures onto your scalp, where it could seep right down into your<br />
  brain?&quot;<br />
  Ernie looked at the bottle of shampoo uneasily. &quot;You mean, it<br />
  could, like, take over your brain?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Could be,&quot; Captain Memory agreed. &quot;However, it doesn't work<br />
  all at once. It has to seep in little by little. The more you wash<br />
  your hair, the worse it gets.&quot;<br />
  Ernie was suddenly glad he didn't wash his hair too often. He<br />
  thought for a moment. &quot;So, people who wash their hair a lot would<br />
  get it the worst, right?&quot;<br />
  &quot;You got it,&quot; Captain Memory assented cheerfully.<br />
  Ernie considered the problem. &quot;So, who washes their hair the<br />
  most?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Pretty girls!&quot; the Fly chimed in. &quot;They wash their hair every<br />
  day, sometimes more than once. I know, 'cause every time I ask one<br />
  out one, she says `I can't go today, I gotta wash my hair'!&quot;<br />
  &quot;That's true,&quot; Ernie admitted. He thought a moment.<br />
  &quot;Wait a minute! We have this stuff at home. In fact, my girlfriend<br />
  uses it!&quot;<br />
  The Captain considered this. &quot;Noticed any changes in her<br />
  recently?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well, she has been kind of...cold,&quot; Ernie conceded. &quot;And, now<br />
  that you mention it, I have noticed her skin getting kind of scaly,<br />
  but I thought it was just the heartbreak of psoriasis. I tried to<br />
  say something about it, but she hissed at me!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Mmm hmm,&quot; Captain Memory agreed.<br />
  &quot;Y'know, I noticed that a lot too,&quot; the Fly added. &quot;I'm real<br />
  observant, and I noticed that an awful lot of pretty girls nowadays<br />
  have forked tongues!&quot;<br />
  Ernie frowned. He had noticed something odd about his<br />
  girlfriend's tongue, but he hadn't wanted to mention it. He didn't<br />
  want to get hissed at again.<br />
  &quot;They also have real sharp teeth,&quot; the Fly continued. &quot;And<br />
  slit pupils in their eyes. I don't think that's normal, do you?&quot;<br />
  All of this was making Ernie very unhappy. &quot;You mean, aliens<br />
  are trying to take over the Earth?&quot; he asked.<br />
  &quot;I wouldn't doubt it,&quot; Captain Memory answered cheerfully.<br />
  &quot;Well, what are we going to do about it?!&quot; cried Ernie.<br />
  &quot;Oh, you don't need to worry about it,&quot; said the Captain<br />
  reassuringly.<br />
  &quot;Why not?&quot; asked Ernie suspiciously.<br />
  &quot;It's just a game anyway, right?&quot; The Captain gave Ernie a<br />
  cheery smile, and helped himself to a piece of lemon meringue pie.<br />
  &quot;There is one thing you could do,&quot; Sterno added.<br />
  &quot;What?!&quot; asked Ernie desperately.<br />
  &quot;You could put some clothes on,&quot; Sterno said, looking ruefully<br />
  at the peach frappe' on his plate. &quot;The sight of all that naked<br />
  skin is rather spoiling my appetite.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, all right!&quot; Ernie snapped, stomping off to the<br />
  bathroom.<br />
  Sterno sighed. &quot;Some people are so sensitive!&quot; he commented,<br />
  reaching for a large Cherries Jubilee.<br />
  Ernie was somewhat placated to find that the luster had<br />
  returned to his toreador suit. The only thing worse than having to<br />
  go around in a toreador outfit was having to go around in a DIRTY<br />
  toreador outfit. He returned to the main room.<br />
  The Fly was eating what seemed to be large cookies of some<br />
  kind. &quot;Hey, these are good gingerbread men!&quot; he remarked, offering<br />
  one to Ernie.<br />
  Ernie examined the cookie. &quot;It's not a man,&quot; he said<br />
  thoughtfully. &quot;It looks like a gingerbread...reptile.&quot;<br />
  The Fly looked at the cookies. &quot;Yeah, you're right.&quot; He<br />
  vacuumed another one up through his snout. &quot;They're good, though.&quot;<br />
  Ernie looked at the cookie ruefully. &quot;I don't know if I want<br />
  to eat a reptile.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Might as well,&quot; Captain Memory volunteered. &quot;It wouldn't<br />
  hesitate to eat you!&quot;<br />
  Ernie put the cookie down quickly. He seemed to have lost his<br />
  appetite again.<br />
  Ernie heard footsteps approaching the house. A man in a post<br />
  office uniform, carrying a bag of mail, was coming up the walk.<br />
  &quot;Howdy!&quot; the mailman said cheerfully. &quot;Nice day, isn't it?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Uh, yeah.&quot; Ernie thought he should be the one to answer,<br />
  since everyone else had their mouths full.<br />
  The mailman chatted on cheerily. &quot;Had a few Nazis a mite<br />
  earlier, but it looks like it cleared up!&quot; He looked through his<br />
  mail. &quot;Is there a `Mr. Ernest Ross' here?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Uh, that's me,&quot; Ernie answered unenthusiastically.<br />
  &quot;Here you go!&quot; The mailman handed Ernie a letter. &quot;Have a nice<br />
  day!&quot; He left.<br />
  Ernie opened the letter and read:</p>
<p>&quot;Dear Mr. Ross,</p>
<p> We are still awaiting payment on your unpaid balance of<br />
  $195,412,771,213,312,032.29. This account is now two billion years<br />
  and two days overdue. Do not force us to turn this matter over to<br />
  a collection agency. Don't let a little matter like this ruin your<br />
  credit rating. You don't want the shame of having your name dragged<br />
  through the mud, do you? You will never be allowed to buy anything<br />
  on credit ever again. People on the street will point at you and<br />
  jeer. Your entire family will be ostracized from decent society.<br />
  Your dog will turn upon you. Your aged parents will be thrown out<br />
  of their home, your children will be spat upon, even your<br />
  childrens' children, yea, unto the seventh generation!<br />
  Save yourself from embarrassment and inconvenience by paying<br />
  this balance now! Use the enclosed envelope for your remittance.&quot;<br />
  Ernie looked between the pages. There was no enclosed envelope. He<br />
  read on.<br />
  &quot;Sincerely,</p>
<p>First National Bank of the West</p>
<p>P.S. If you are experiencing financial difficulties at the moment,<br />
  please contact one of our representatives to work out a payment<br />
  plan. As little as a trillion dollars a month could satisfactorily<br />
  take care of this account. Thank you!&quot;<br />
  Ernie sighed. &quot;Isn't there anywhere you can go to get away<br />
  from junk mail?&quot;<br />
  &quot;I doubt it,&quot; answered Captain Memory, cutting himself a big<br />
  slice of pineapple upside-down cake.<br />
  Ernie sighed, and sat down on the nearest piece of furniture,<br />
  which happened to be a child's rocking chair which was a bit too<br />
  small for him. Ernie noticed, while squeezing himself into it, that<br />
  the arms were scraping some of the sequins off his suit. Looking<br />
  down, he noticed that sequins had been falling off his suit all<br />
  along, leaving a sparkly trail as he walked. Oh great, he thought.<br />
  Now, on top of everything else, my suit is shedding.<br />
  Captain Memory looked at his bare wrist. &quot;I guess it must be<br />
  just about time for the Eggplant Uprising,&quot; he commented.<br />
  &quot;The what?&quot; Ernie was confused, as usual.<br />
  &quot;Oh, come on!&quot; The Captain was annoyed. &quot;Don't you pay<br />
  attention to anything I tell you? You know, the Revolt of the<br />
  Vegetables, the Purple Menace; remember, when they nuked us back to<br />
  the Stone Age?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, sure,&quot; Ernie remembered being nuked well enough. He had<br />
  some vague recollection of the other stuff, too. He decided to<br />
  pretend he remembered the rest of it as well, since he was tired of<br />
  being picked on for not paying attention. &quot;So, uh, what about it?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well, anyway,&quot; the Captain went on. &quot;After the Great Traffic<br />
  Jam...&quot;<br />
  &quot;The what?!&quot; Ernie broke in involuntarily.<br />
  &quot;Oh, you're right,&quot; said the Captain, slightly abashed. &quot;I<br />
  didn't tell you about that. The Great Traffic Jam took place<br />
  because of this problem they had due to chronic over-production of<br />
  cars. You see, they just kept building all these cars, and people<br />
  kept buying them, just for the heck of it, even though they didn't<br />
  have anyplace to go in them. Well, of course, it had to happen: one<br />
  particularly nice summer day everybody decided to go for a drive<br />
  all at the same time. They wound up bumper-to-bumper, coast-to-<br />
  coast. The entire country was tied up in total gridlock. People<br />
  didn't know what to do; they didn't know how to get around without<br />
  their cars anymore. It was terrible; there was mass starvation.<br />
  Thousands died; vultures picked their bones through their<br />
  convertible tops. Well, I'm sure you can see that under<br />
  circumstances like these, people were in no mood for a practical<br />
  joke!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Uh, right!&quot; Ernie thought he'd just agree, and maybe the<br />
  Captain would go on with the story without noticing that Ernie<br />
  wasn't following the story at all.<br />
  Ernie was lucky. The Captain continued: &quot;Well, you can imagine<br />
  how people felt when rumors began to fly about certain species of<br />
  giant plants that had escaped from the atomic testing laboratories<br />
  and had grown to enormous size by feasting on human flesh. And how<br />
  these plants were determined to get revenge on the entire animal<br />
  kingdom for the millions of years of abuse they and their plant<br />
  brothers had had to put up with at the hands (and paws, and<br />
  muzzles, and so on) of non-vegetable life forms.&quot;<br />
  Ernie furled his brow. &quot;Does that have anything to do with the<br />
  Vegetable Rights Movement?&quot;<br />
  &quot;You got it!&quot; agreed Captain Memory. <br />
  Ernie felt a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach. In<br />
  spite of himself, he WAS beginning to remember all this! He didn't<br />
  WANT to remember it, because if he remembered it, that meant....<br />
  Ernie didn't want to think about what that meant.<br />
  &quot;Anyway,&quot; the Captain continued. &quot;They were going to organize<br />
  all the vegetables, stage a massive uprising, and eliminate all<br />
  animal life for ever! On top of all this, these plants were<br />
  invulnerable to conventional weapons, and could only be destroyed<br />
  by the atomic fires that had created them!<br />
  &quot;Small wonder, then, that general panic broke out when<br />
  something very large and very purple raised it's leafy head over<br />
  the city of Chicago.&quot; Captain Memory chuckled.<br />
  &quot;Oh, wow!&quot; said Ernie. This was really creepy. It was a lot<br />
  like telling ghost stories around the campfire at camp. &quot;So, it was<br />
  a giant, man-eating eggplant?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Don't be silly! How could there be a such a thing as a giant,<br />
  man-eating eggplant?&quot; Captain Memory was amused. &quot;No, it was just<br />
  practical joke. It was that zany Andreas Labyrinth and his band of<br />
  merry pranksters, up to their little games again.&quot; Captain Memory<br />
  chortled. &quot;I still remember that phony Russian invasion. That was<br />
  really a riot! Or how about that bogus epidemic! That had everybody<br />
  in stitches!&quot;<br />
  Something about that explanation didn't seem quite right to<br />
  Ernie, but he wasn't in the mood to try to figure out what it was.<br />
  He wanted to hear the rest of Captain Memory's story. &quot;So then what<br />
  happened, uh, will happen, uh...so, what about the Eggplant?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well, as I was saying,&quot; Captain Memory always enjoyed telling<br />
  stories. &quot;It wasn't really a giant Eggplant, it was really just a<br />
  big purple balloon. But it looked a lot like a giant eggplant, you<br />
  know, big scary face painted on it and all. I suppose, in saner<br />
  times, people might have questioned the whole thing a little more<br />
  closely. After all, there wasn't really any proof that it was a<br />
  giant eggplant. It could have been a giant grape. No reason to nuke<br />
  a giant grape, is there?&quot;<br />
  &quot;I guess not.&quot; Ernie supposed he might as well agree, since he<br />
  couldn't think of any reason on Earth to nuke a giant grape.<br />
  &quot;But, people just didn't stop and think,&quot; the Captain went on.<br />
  &quot;They just went ahead and dropped the bomb. And when they found<br />
  out, boy, were they mad!&quot; Captain Memory chuckled. &quot;Of course, it<br />
  isn't really funny if it doesn't make somebody mad, is it? That's<br />
  what practical jokes are all about!&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory paused. &quot;But, anyway, all of this should be<br />
  taking place just about&quot; he looked at his bare wrist, &quot;Now!&quot; A<br />
  sound like that of distant thunder shook the house.<br />
  Ernie looked out the window. &quot;Chicago?&quot; he asked.<br />
  &quot;Yup!&quot; answered the Captain. &quot;There it goes!&quot;<br />
  Ernie thought a moment. &quot;Did they nuke Chicago twice?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Why would they want to do something like that?&quot; Captain<br />
  Memory wondered. &quot;Once you nuke it, it stays nuked!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well, in that case,&quot; Ernie pondered. &quot;How could we be in<br />
  Chicago just before it got nuked, before, when we're here just<br />
  before it got nuked, now?&quot; <br />
  Captain Memory frowned. &quot;That is confusing, isn't it? I've<br />
  never quite figured that out.&quot; The Captain didn't seem overly upset<br />
  about the problem.<br />
  Ernie decided that it probably wouldn't be good for him to<br />
  think about that problem anymore. He decided to think about<br />
  something else.<br />
  &quot;So, what ever happened to that practical joker, that Andreas<br />
  Whats-His-Name?&quot; he asked.<br />
  As if in answer to this question, a figure burst through the<br />
  door. It was an older man, with a wild white beard and hair. His<br />
  clothes were in tatters, and he was covered with splotches of egg,<br />
  rotten tomatoes, and other things too disgusting to think about.<br />
  &quot;Hide me, hide me!&quot; he implored. &quot;They're after me! They'll tear me<br />
  to pieces! It was just a joke! I didn't know they'd take it<br />
  seriously! It was just a practical joke!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well...&quot;Ernie began.<br />
  Suddenly, the man seemed to see Ernie clearly for the first<br />
  time. &quot;A BULLFIGHTER!&quot; He looked at Captain Memory. &quot;A comic-book<br />
  character!&quot; He looked at the Fly. &quot;A GIANT FLY!&quot;<br />
  &quot;What IS your problem?&quot; Sterno demanded.<br />
  &quot;A TALKING DOG!&quot; the man shrieked. &quot;You're all worse than me!<br />
  I've got to get out of here! They'll tear you all to pieces!&quot; With<br />
  that, the man threw himself through the nearest window, which,<br />
  luckily, had been glazed with large panes of sugar instead of<br />
  glass. He sprinted towards a group of trees behind the house, and<br />
  disappeared into a large hole beneath one of them. Ernie thought he<br />
  saw a large white rabbit with a watch disappear into the hole as<br />
  well, but he wasn't sure.<br />
  Captain Memory looked at his bare wrist. &quot;I'd really like to<br />
  get a watch,&quot; he commented. &quot;It doesn't have to be anything fancy.<br />
  A Timex would be okay.&quot;<br />
  The Fly was looking out the door. &quot;Uh oh,&quot; he said ominously.<br />
  &quot;Here they come!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Here WHO comes?&quot; Ernie demanded anxiously.<br />
  &quot;The angry villagers!&quot; the Fly said unhappily. &quot;You know, with<br />
  the torches and the rocks and everything? You don't want to mess<br />
  with the angry villagers, man. They're mean!&quot; They Fly shuddered.<br />
  He seemed to have had some kind of bad experience with them in the<br />
  past.<br />
  &quot;Uh, maybe we ought to get out of here?&quot; Ernie suggested.<br />
  &quot;I haven't finished my strawberry mousse!&quot; Sterno said<br />
  petulantly.<br />
  &quot;Oh man, I don't know what we're gonna do,&quot; said the Fly<br />
  miserably. &quot;They're closing in on us from all sides!&quot;<br />
  Ernie peered through the broken window. He could see the smoke<br />
  from their torches in the distance. It occurred to him that perhaps<br />
  they should barricade the door, or something. Unfortunately, the<br />
  door had already been broken off its hinges by the Nazis. Ernie put<br />
  it upright in the doorframe as best he could, and shoved a small<br />
  rocking chair up against it to hold it.<br />
  &quot;I don't think that's gonna stop anybody,&quot; the Fly said<br />
  glumly. <br />
  Ernie could hear angry shouts. The villagers were approaching<br />
  fast. &quot;I think we better do something!&quot; Ernie urged Captain Memory.<br />
  &quot;Oh yeah?&quot; Captain Memory looked up unconcernedly. &quot;Like<br />
  what?&quot;<br />
  With a crash, a rock came sailing through on of the unbroken<br />
  windows. The angry shouts were quite close now. Ernie couldn't<br />
  understand them, though. They seemed to be in German.<br />
  A burning torch came sailing through an open window. Another<br />
  landed just outside the door. Thick black smoke began to fill the<br />
  air.<br />
  &quot;Ew, burning sugar!&quot; complained Sterno. &quot;How rank!&quot;<br />
  The Fly peeked out a window. &quot;Oh man, those angry villagers!<br />
  They're bad news!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Hey, this place is burning up!&quot; Ernie urged Captain Memory.<br />
  &quot;We've got to DO something!&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory made a wry face. &quot;Well, I guess there's no<br />
  point in hanging around HERE anymore!&quot; He thought a moment. &quot;Let's<br />
  try 011F 0D 0001!&quot; The scene vanished.</p>
<p> *              *              *</p>
<p> Blinking, Ernie found himself once again in an entirely<br />
  different place. He staggered, and his stomach flip-flopped. &quot;Oh,<br />
  man&quot;, he moaned. &quot;I don't know if I can take these sudden changes<br />
  of scene anymore.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh,&quot; Captain Memory seemed surprised. &quot;Would you rather be<br />
  back at the gingerbread cottage?&quot; <br />
  Ernie straightened up abruptly. &quot;No, no that's okay. I'm fine,<br />
  just fine. I&quot;d just as soon be right...um... He looked around.<br />
  Captain Memory, the Fly, and Sterno were all looking around as<br />
  well. They were in what appeared to be a large government office.<br />
  It was a big room, with a high, arched ceiling, lit by rows of<br />
  fluorescent lights. The walls were painted eye-saver green. `It<br />
  looks like an old-fashioned post office or something,' Ernie<br />
  thought. <br />
  In the middle of the room was a long row of tables with forms<br />
  in little pigeonholes and pens attached by chains. A row of windows<br />
  occupied one wall, each with a bored-looking clerk doing something<br />
  with papers. A sign above the windows said `Federal Bureau of<br />
  Drawers'. <br />
  Ernie was puzzled. &quot;Why did you bring us here?&quot; He asked<br />
  Captain Memory.<br />
  &quot;This isn't quite what I expected,&quot; admitted the Captain. He<br />
  seemed just as puzzled as Ernie. &quot;Actually, I didn't really want to<br />
  leave. I really wanted to have another piece of cake - German<br />
  chocolate, as a matter of fact.&quot; He sighed. &quot;I guess I won't get my<br />
  cake now.&quot;<br />
  Ernie sighed as well. He wished he had taken advantage of the<br />
  opportunity to eat something while they were still at the cottage.<br />
  He was beginning to get really hungry, and it didn't look like he<br />
  was going to be able to find anything to eat here.<br />
  Ernie looked around. &quot;What is this place?&quot;<br />
  The Captain regarded the building thoughfully. &quot;I'm not sure,<br />
  but I think it's a database.&quot;<br />
  &quot;A database?&quot; Ernie was confused. &quot;I thought data in<br />
  Cyberspace was supposed to look like big, glowing geometric forms<br />
  that you could fly around in!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Yeah, well you could do that if you wanted,&quot; the Captain<br />
  explained. &quot;But businesses usually don't. They secretaries don't<br />
  like 'em. They like something a little more, you know, traditional.<br />
  Like this!&quot; He gestured at the building around them.<br />
  Their discussion was interrupted by a shrill, nasal voice.<br />
  &quot;Next, please!&quot; Ernie looked around confusedly. &quot;That's you!&quot; An<br />
  unpleasant-looking older woman with her hair pulled back in a tight<br />
  bun seemed to be pointing at him. &quot;Step up to the window, please!&quot;<br />
  Ernie looked at Captain Memory. &quot;What should we do?&quot;<br />
  The Captain shrugged. &quot;I guess we should step up to the<br />
  window.&quot; They did so.<br />
  &quot;Hello!&quot; Captain Memory said pleasantly to the woman behind<br />
  the window. &quot;Can you tell us why we're here?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Certainly,&quot; she said through tight lips.<br />
  Captain Memory smiled. &quot;See,&quot; he said to Ernie. &quot;This isn't<br />
  going to be hard at all!&quot; <br />
  The woman behind the window smirked unpleasantly. &quot;Just fill<br />
  out this form.&quot; She handed a thick sheaf of papers to Captain<br />
  Memory.<br />
  The Captain's face fell. &quot;What's this for?&quot;<br />
  The woman smirked happily. &quot;That's a form 4729, `Request for<br />
  Information'. I assume you have your authorized Form 7391 with<br />
  you?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Uh, I don't think so,&quot; the Captain answered confusedly. &quot;What<br />
  is it?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, you must have your Form 7391, `Request for Request for<br />
  Information' completely filled out, authorized, and validated<br />
  before we can process your Form 4729, `Request for Information'.<br />
  Oh, you don't have a Form 7391? Here you are!&quot; The woman handed<br />
  Captain Memory another thick sheaf of papers.<br />
  Captain Memory looked very unhappy. He leafed though the<br />
  forms. &quot;These are real long,&quot; he complained.<br />
  &quot;Be sure to read ALL the directions,&quot; the woman simpered<br />
  cheerfully. Her mood seemed to be improving with every passing<br />
  form. &quot;And fill in all the blanks, except those marked `Do Not Fill<br />
  In This Blank'. Of course, if you fail to fill in any of the<br />
  correct blanks, or if you should happen to fill in any blank marked<br />
  `Do Not Fill In This Blank', then you'll have to start ALL over<br />
  again!&quot; She cackled with glee at the thought.<br />
  &quot;And, of course, you'll need a Form 6729, `Request for<br />
  Authorization of Forms', a Form 3451, `Request for Validation of<br />
  Forms', a Form 4472b, `Request for Instructions for Authorization<br />
  and Validation of Forms', and a Form 2392A, `Application for<br />
  Verification of Authorization and Validation.'&quot; She handed Captain<br />
  Memory four more thick forms.  He now had a pile of forms about<br />
  eight inches high in front of him. &quot;And, of course,&quot; she said to<br />
  Ernie &quot;We'll need a complete set of forms from you as well,&quot; she<br />
  handed Ernie a similar stack of papers. &quot;And from you, and from<br />
  you.&quot; She handed the Fly and Sterno each their own stack. The woman<br />
  seemed positively ecstatic now. <br />
  Ernie looked at the pile in shock. &quot;There's... there's<br />
  thousands of them!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh yes,&quot; said the woman gleefully. &quot;There used to be only<br />
  hundreds, but ever since they passed the Paperwork Reduction Act<br />
  we've had far more!&quot;<br />
  Ernie regarded the papers with dismay.<br />
  &quot;After you've filled all those out,&quot; the woman continued<br />
  delightedly. &quot;We'll start on the rest!&quot;<br />
  The foursome took their piles of forms to the tables in the<br />
  middle of the room and began leafing through them despondently.<br />
  &quot;These government offices are always so depressing,&quot; Sterno<br />
  complained. &quot;Why must they always paint them that ghastly shade of<br />
  green?&quot;<br />
  Ernie decided that he agreed with Sterno, but he was too<br />
  depressed to talk. He began leafing listlessly through his Form<br />
  2392, `Application for Verification of Authorization and<br />
  Validation', for no other reason than that it happened to be at the<br />
  top of the pile. It started out straightforwardly enough:</p>
<p>Name:                              Social Security #:<br />
  Father's Name:                     Mother's Name:<br />
  Mother's Maiden Name:<br />
  DO NOT WRITE IN THIS SPACE<br />
</p>
<p>Grandfather's Name:<br />
  Grandmother's Name:<br />
  Ernie tried to fill in his name, but the pen on the little<br />
  chain wouldn't write. Instead, he flipped a few pages ahead.</p>
<p>Great Grandmother on your Father's Mother's Side's Maiden Name:<br />
  Great Grandmother on your Father's Mother's Side's Dependent <br />
  Children Living with Her at the Time of Marriage (if any) Names:<br />
  DO NOT WRITE IN THIS SPACE<br />
  STOP! Did you write in this space? If so, take the letters of<br />
  your name, add their numerical equivalents to your date of birth,<br />
  and turn to the appropriate section as indicated by the table on<br />
  page 349. Follow directions carefully. Then, discard this form and<br />
  start all over. <br />
  Ernie sighed. He leafed ahead a few more pages. </p>
<p> ENTER ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:<br />
  (a)Your Adjusted Gross Income, minus Unrecovered<br />
  Depreciation otherwise deductible on Form 692A, but including<br />
  Accrued Losses not otherwise reported on this Form.<br />
  (b)The sum total of all the money you ever made in your<br />
  entire life.<br />
  (c)The sum total of the sum total of all the money you<br />
  ever made in your entire life AND all the money your father and/or<br />
  mother made in their entire lives OR;<br />
  (d)How much you got?<br />
  Complete the above and roll again. If doubles, forfeit one<br />
  turn. Otherwise, proceed to the nearest RR and pay owner TWICE what<br />
  he would otherwise receive. Do NOT pass GO; do NOT collect $200.</p>
<p> DO NOT WRITE IN THIS SPACE<br />
</p>
<p> Ernie looked up. &quot;Do you get the feeling they're playing games<br />
  with us?&quot; he asked the others.<br />
  &quot;Oh NO!&quot; cried the Fly desperately.<br />
  &quot;What!?&quot; said Ernie, alarmed.<br />
  &quot;I wrote in the space that says `Do Not Write in This Space'&quot;,<br />
  wailed the Fly.<br />
  &quot;Tsk, tsk,&quot; said Sterno. &quot;You're in big trouble now!&quot;<br />
  Ernie was glad that it was someone other than himself who was<br />
  in big trouble, for a change. He looked over at Captain Memory.<br />
  The Captain was having a hard time filling out his forms. He<br />
  seemed to have gotten stuck. Ernie looked over his shoulder. As a<br />
  matter of fact, the Captain seemed to have gotten stuck on the<br />
  first space, `NAME:'. &quot;Should I put `Captain Memory' or `Memory,<br />
  Captain?'&quot; he mused.<br />
  Ernie noticed that the Captain's form was different from his.<br />
  Ernie read:</p>
<p> NAME:<br />
  RANK:<br />
  SERIAL NUMBER:<br />
  In twenty-five (25) words or less, explain how you manage to<br />
  travel through Cyberspace without stopping at the approprite<br />
  checkpoints and/or checksums. Be concise; use specific examples,<br />
  and remember, neatness counts!<br />
  If you need more room, use a separate sheet.</p>
<p> DO NOT WRITE IN THIS SPACE</p>
<p> &quot;I know!&quot; said Captain Memory. &quot;I can put `Memory' under<br />
  `Name:', and `Captain' under `Rank:'. I wonder what I should put<br />
  under `Cereal Number:'?&quot;<br />
  Ernie suddenly became very uneasy. &quot;I think maybe we should<br />
  just get out of here while we have the chance!&quot;<br />
  Sterno was leafing through his pile of papers. &quot;Aha!&quot; he<br />
  cried. &quot;Here we go: Form 1193, `Request for Authorization to Apply<br />
  for a License to Purchase Cigars'! Now we're getting somewhere!&quot;<br />
  Sterno did not find the forms upsetting at all. In fact, he seemed<br />
  to be the only one able to deal with them. He began scribbling<br />
  industriously in the blanks. As Ernie watched, he took his sheaf of<br />
  forms to one of the windows, where it was stamped. He then took it<br />
  to another window, where a large gold seal was affixed to it. Then<br />
  on to another window, where several people signed it. He then<br />
  disappeared around a corner, and returned, moments later, carrying<br />
  a large box of cigars.<br />
  &quot;Wow!&quot; The Fly was awestruck. &quot;That's amazing! I wonder how he<br />
  does that!&quot;<br />
  &quot;It's not really that difficult,&quot; commented Sterno, lighting<br />
  up a big cigar. His disposition always improved tremendously when<br />
  he had a cigar. &quot;I'll tell you a secret: the universe is actually<br />
  a giant bureaucracy. It's possible to get anything in the Cosmos<br />
  done, if you fill out the right forms. However, filling out the<br />
  right forms can sometimes be very difficult indeed.&quot; He puffed his<br />
  cigar appreciatively. &quot;Havanas, no less! One needs a special permit<br />
  to get these, I'll have you know!&quot; <br />
  The Fly, meanwhile, was intent on trying to erase what he had<br />
  written in the space marked `Do Not Write in This Space'. So far,<br />
  he had only succeeded in tearing a hole in the paper.<br />
  Ernie, meanwhile, was noticing the fact that all the clerks<br />
  and tellers seemed to be watching them. Another unusual thing<br />
  struck him. &quot;Hey guys,&quot; he commented. &quot;Did you notice that there's<br />
  all these clerks and all these officials, but no customers besides<br />
  us?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Egad, that IS odd,&quot; agreed Sterno. &quot;Everyone knows that the<br />
  usual ratio is 116,312 customers per clerk.&quot; He looked around.<br />
  &quot;Where ARE all the lines? I've never seen a government office this<br />
  empty, except of course at the Administration for Not Doing<br />
  Anything At All Building, and even there only after 5:00 P.M. on<br />
  weekends. It does seem suspicious!&quot;<br />
  Ernie was thrilled that for once, someone agreed with him.<br />
  &quot;Okay, well that proves it, right? So let's get out of here, okay?&quot;<br />
  &quot;I've got it!&quot; cried Captain Memory. He grabbed a pen, and<br />
  wrote in large, childlike block letters in the space marked `Serial<br />
  Number:' `FROSTED FLAKES'. &quot;There!&quot; he said, beaming. He looked at<br />
  the next line, and his face fell. &quot;Oh, it's an essay question! I<br />
  hate essay questions!&quot;<br />
  &quot;So let's get out of here, okay?&quot; Ernie urged. He felt more<br />
  uneasy with each passing moment.<br />
  Captain Memory sighed. &quot;I guess we might as well. I'm never<br />
  gonna finish this thing!&quot; He pushed the pile of papers aside. Ernie<br />
  began slowly heading toward the door, acutely aware of all the<br />
  clerks watching him. He tried to act as nonchalant as possible,<br />
  whistling a little tune and shuffling his feet as he walked.<br />
  &quot;Just a minute!&quot; he heard the old woman clerk cry out. &quot;Just<br />
  WHERE do you think you're going?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Uh..uh..&quot; Ernie stammered.<br />
  &quot;Don't you know you're not allowed to leave without filling<br />
  out a Form 9150, `Application for Authorization to Apply for<br />
  Permission for an Interruption in Completion of Forms'!&quot; she<br />
  shrieked. &quot;Get back here!&quot;<br />
  Ernie thought fast. &quot;Uh, I gotta go to the bathroom!&quot;<br />
  The old woman glared at the other three. &quot;And what about YOU?&quot;<br />
  The others followed Ernie's lead. &quot;Uh, we all gotta go to the<br />
  bathroom!&quot; they chorused in unison.<br />
  The clerk scowled. &quot;All right! Fill out this Form 7711,<br />
  `Request for Permission to Apply for Authorization for Admission to<br />
  the Sanitary Facility'!&quot; she snapped. &quot;Anyway, you're going the<br />
  wrong way! The bathroom's that way!&quot; She pointed down a long<br />
  corridor which seemed to disappear into the bowels of the building.<br />
  Ernie looked at the others. &quot;RUN!!&quot; he yelled. They all<br />
  sprinted for the door.<br />
  &quot;Stop them!&quot; shrieked the old woman, but they were already<br />
  through the door.<br />
  Outside, they found themselves on the dingy streets of what<br />
  appeared to be a large city greatly in need of urban renewal. &quot;We'd<br />
  better keep moving,&quot; Ernie urged. &quot;They're right behind us!&quot;<br />
  The Fly looked back. &quot;No, they're not.&quot;<br />
  Ernie stopped, confused, and turned around. Sure enough, there<br />
  was no sign of pursuit. &quot;Why aren't they chasing us?&quot; Ernie<br />
  wondered.<br />
  &quot;Oh, here's the reason,&quot; said Captain Memory regarding his<br />
  bare wrist. &quot;It's five o'clock. Civil servants never work past<br />
  five!&quot;  He continued to regard his bare wrist. &quot;I'd really like to<br />
  get a watch!&quot; <br />
  Ernie breathed a sigh of relief. &quot;So, we're safe, then?&quot;<br />
  &quot;At least till nine o'clock tomorrow morning,&quot; Captain Memory<br />
  agreed. He looked around brightly. &quot;Let's go for a walk! Maybe we<br />
  can find a jewelry store somewhere around here!&quot; Captain Memory<br />
  paused reflectively, looking at his bare wrist. &quot;It doesn't have to<br />
  be a Rolex. A Seiko would be okay. Of course, I wouldn't mind a<br />
  Rolex!&quot; They began strolling down the street.<br />
  As they neared the corner, they began to hear music in the<br />
  distance. Ernie recognized the sound of steel drums and guitars.<br />
  &quot;Reggae!&quot; he said. &quot;Somebody's playing reggae music around here!&quot;<br />
  Ernie relaxed. While he wasn't a particular fan of reggae music, it<br />
  made him fell more at home to come across anything at all he could<br />
  recognize.<br />
  As they turned the corner, they came upon a group of black<br />
  people who seemed to be having a party. They wore bright-colored<br />
  clothes, and had their hair hanging down in long braids.<br />
  &quot;Dreadlocks!&quot; Ernie recognized. &quot;They must be Rastafarians!&quot; <br />
  The Fly seemed totally confused by these people. &quot;Hey, guy!&quot;<br />
  he said to one of them. &quot;Uh, do you live around here?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, no mon,&quot; the man answered in a thick Jamaican accent. &quot;We<br />
  not from here, mon. We from de Islands. We Rastas!&quot;<br />
  In spite of himself, Ernie found himself becoming suspicious.<br />
  For one thing, they didn't look like other black people Ernie knew.<br />
  There was something funny about their skin tone. It was unusually<br />
  black, and it seemed to be coming off on objects around them. Out<br />
  of a corner of his eye, Ernie noticed a trash can nearby. It seemed<br />
  to be full of empty bottles of black shoe polish.<br />
  Another of the Rastafarians approached the Fly. &quot;Hey,<br />
  brother,&quot; he said, pointing at the Fly's antenna. &quot;You got de<br />
  dreadlocks too, I see. Here, smoke some of dis ganja!&quot; He handed<br />
  the Fly a funny-looking cigarette.<br />
  &quot;Uh, thanks.&quot; The Fly accepted the cigarette. However, he<br />
  couldn't seem to fit it into his snout, no matter which way he held<br />
  it.<br />
  Ernie heard the reassuring strains of Bob Marley and the<br />
  Wailers drifting out through a nearby doorway, but he was unable to<br />
  shake his suspicions. He noticed something unusual about the man's<br />
  footwear. &quot;Since when do Rastas wear jackboots?&quot;<br />
  The man seemed momentarily nonplussed, but quickly recovered<br />
  his composure. &quot;Oh sure, mon. We all wear de jackboots now. It's de<br />
  new `in' thing.&quot; He turned to the Fly. &quot;Ain't dat right, brother?&quot;<br />
  The Fly had managed to get a grip on the cigarette with his<br />
  snout, and was puffing away. He started to giggle. &quot;Jackboots!<br />
  Sure! Why not!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Dere you go, mon,&quot; the Rasta said reassuringly, while taking<br />
  out a monocle and fitting it into his eye. &quot;You got nothin' to<br />
  worry about! We just Rastas, mon. We not Nazis, or nothin'!&quot; He<br />
  laughed. &quot;Oh, no!&quot;<br />
  The Fly was giggling uncontrollably now. &quot;Hey, that's GREAT<br />
  music!&quot; he said enthusiastically. &quot;You guys are really alright!<br />
  This is FUN!&quot; He broke down into fits of hysterical giggling.<br />
  &quot;Take it easy, mon,&quot; the Rasta said to Ernie. &quot;My name's Jack.<br />
  I from Monterey. Dey call me Monterey Jack!&quot;<br />
  Sterno stiffened. &quot;Monterey Jack! Do you know what that is!?&quot;<br />
  he hissed. &quot;It's...it's CHEESE!&quot;<br />
  The Rasta stood abruptly up, the monocle dropping out of his<br />
  eye. &quot;SEIZE THEM!&quot; he shrieked, his Islands accent abruptly<br />
  vanishing.<br />
  &quot;RUN!&quot; shouted Ernie and Sterno together.<br />
  &quot;Hey guys, what's the rush?&quot; asked the Fly, his head lolling<br />
  from side to side. &quot;Isn't this a FUN party?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Come ON!&quot; Ernie grabbed the Fly's tie and pulled him along<br />
  like a puppy on a leash. The ran down the narrow street, the Fly<br />
  stumbling and giggling. Close behind them were the imitation<br />
  Rastas, discarding their Caribbean clothes as they ran to reveal<br />
  Nazi uniforms beneath. &quot;Quick, in here!&quot; Ernie pulled the Fly into<br />
  an open doorway, followed by Sterno and Captain Memory. Inside was<br />
  a flight of stairs. They ran up the stairs and through a door at<br />
  the first landing, to find themselves in a long corridor, lined by<br />
  rows of doors.<br />
  &quot;Looks like an apartment building, or maybe a hotel,&quot; Ernie<br />
  observed. &quot;Maybe we can find a room to hide in!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Good idea!&quot; Sterno agreed.<br />
  &quot;I'd like a room with a TV, if you don't mind,&quot; Captain Memory<br />
  added. Ernie glared at him, and hurried down the hall, still<br />
  dragging the Fly by the necktie.<br />
  An open door beckoned. The four rushed into what appeared to<br />
  be an ordinary, somewhat run-down hotel room, slammed the door<br />
  behind them, and locked it.<br />
  &quot;Whew!&quot; Ernie breathed a sigh of relief. &quot;Well, I don't think<br />
  they can find us in here! Look's like we're safe!&quot;<br />
  The Fly collapsed into an overstuffed chair. He held his hands<br />
  up in front of his face. &quot;Oh wow,&quot; he said wonderingly. &quot;Did you<br />
  ever look at your hands? I mean, really LOOK at them?&quot; He started<br />
  giggling again.<br />
  &quot;Hmmph!&quot; Sterno sniffed. &quot;Some people just can't hold their<br />
  ganja!&quot;<br />
  There was a knock on the door.<br />
  &quot;Ssh!&quot; Ernie cautioned the others. &quot;Let's just be quiet and<br />
  they won't know we're in here!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Ve know you're in dere!&quot; a voice outside the door shouted.<br />
  Ernie was astonished. &quot;How could they know we were in here?&quot;<br />
  he whispered to the others.<br />
  &quot;Dat's easy!&quot; answered the voice from behind them door. &quot;Ve<br />
  just follow ze trail of sequins!&quot;<br />
  Ernie looked at his toreador suit. Large, sparkle-less patches<br />
  confirmed his worst fears. Sure enough, a faint, but clearly<br />
  identifiable trail of sequins led under the door.<br />
  Ernie became aware of everyone glaring at him, except of<br />
  course, the Fly, who was still busily examining his hands. &quot;You,<br />
  again!&quot; snarled Sterno.<br />
  &quot;Well, hey...&quot; Ernie shrugged defensively. &quot;What am I supposed<br />
  to do, you know? I...&quot;<br />
  The knock sounded again, this time louder. &quot;Open up!&quot;<br />
  Ernie looked at the door. I'll be cool about this, he decided.<br />
  Maybe I can fake them out. &quot;Uh, yes?&quot; he called out brightly.<br />
  &quot;Who's there?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Nazis!&quot; came the reply. &quot;Open up!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Uh, no thanks! We don't want any!&quot;<br />
  &quot;You vill open zis door! NOW!&quot;<br />
  Ernie thought fast. &quot;Uh, I'm in the bathroom right now! Could<br />
  you come back later?&quot;<br />
  &quot;BREAK DOWN ZE DOOR!&quot; Something large and heavy thudded into<br />
  the door.<br />
  Ernie looked around the room frantically. &quot;The fire escape!&quot;<br />
  Ernie pointed through an open window. &quot;Quick! Everybody! Out that<br />
  way!&quot; The ran to the window and climbed down the fire escape, Ernie<br />
  pulling the Fly by the necktie. &quot;Hey, what's the rush, guys?&quot; asked<br />
  the Fly, giggling. &quot;We just got here!&quot;<br />
  As they hurried down the fire escape, Ernie heard the sound of<br />
  the door breaking down behind them. &quot;After zem!&quot; a voice cried.<br />
  The bottom of the fire escape led to a narrow alley. Hurrying<br />
  along it, the found themselves facing a large iron door. There was<br />
  no other way out of the alley. The sounds of pursuit were close<br />
  behind them. Ernie tried the doorknob. It was unlocked. &quot;Quick,<br />
  through here!&quot; he shouted.<br />
  They four scrambled through the door and slammed it behind<br />
  them. Inside it was totally dark. Ernie felt along the doorframe<br />
  for a lock. He found one, and locked it. He found another, and<br />
  locked that too. There was also a large bolt, and a huge padlock.<br />
  He locked those as well. &quot;There,&quot; he said. &quot;That should keep them<br />
  out. We're safe now!&quot; He breathed a sigh of relief.<br />
  &quot;Where are we?&quot; he heard Captain Memory's voice ask. &quot;I can't<br />
  see a thing!&quot; <br />
  Ernie inched carefully forward, his hands outstretched, hoping<br />
  to find a lamp, or a light switch, or something. Suddenly, from out<br />
  of the darkness, a voice rang out. &quot;Ah, how nice of you to return!&quot;<br />
  the voice said. &quot;Ve haff been vaiting for you!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Uh oh,&quot; Ernie began. &quot;I think we're in trouble guys!&quot;<br />
  The now-familiar voice of the game-show announcer boomed out.<br />
  &quot;You sure are, because it's time for WHEEL OF TORTURE!&quot;<br />
  There was the sound of tremendous applause.<br />
  The entire scene erupted into blinding light. <br />
  The announcer continued. &quot;And now, for our first contestant:<br />
  from Toledo, Ohio, it's Goombah the Toreador!&quot;<br />
  &quot;My name's Ernie,&quot; Ernie complained. &quot;Gimme a break, huh?&quot;<br />
  &quot;SURE!&quot; the announcer agreed cheerfully. &quot;WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE<br />
  BROKEN?!&quot; Ernie heard uproarious laughter.<br />
  &quot;Say!&quot; the announcer continued. &quot;I just LOVE your suit! You're<br />
  missing a few sequins, though!&quot; Ernie heard laughter again, this<br />
  time cut short in a very artificial-sounding way. His eyes were<br />
  beginning to adjust to the light, but he still couldn't see<br />
  clearly.<br />
  &quot;And here's our second contestant: from Des Moines, Iowa, it's<br />
  Seth Brundage, the Human Fly!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Aw, I wish you wouldn't call me that!&quot; the Fly complained.<br />
  &quot;It makes a real bad impression, you know? Couldn't you just call<br />
  me `Seth'?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Sure thing, Mr. Fly!&quot; the announcer agreed jovially.<br />
  The Fly moaned. &quot;And I'm not from Des Moines, either!&quot;<br />
  Ernie's vision was beginning to clear up. They were,<br />
  unfortunately, back on the stage of `Wheel of Torture'. They seemed<br />
  to have blundered (or been maneuvered) into the same stage they had<br />
  escaped from twice before. Ernie just hoped they would be able to<br />
  escape from it again.<br />
  He looked out towards the audience. There was no audience -<br />
  just empty chairs. Ernie looked around. There were no guards, no<br />
  chorus girls. In fact, there was only one person: the Gestapo's<br />
  greatest, Sturmbannfuhrer Dr. Heinz von Liederkranz, the man whose<br />
  name sounds like cheese! Ernie heard thunderous applause.<br />
  &quot;Tank you, tank you!&quot; von Liederkranz bowed in the direction<br />
  of the non-existent audience. He then reached out and shut off a<br />
  small tape recorder. The applause ended abruptly. He turned on<br />
  another small tape recorder. &quot;And now, on with the show!&quot; the<br />
  recorded voice of the announcer rang out. Von Liederkranz shut that<br />
  one off, too.<br />
  &quot;Zo, ve meet again!&quot; Von Liederkranz smiled unpleasantly. &quot;Now<br />
  you are in my power! You vill tell me vhat I vant to know!&quot;<br />
  Ernie looked at the empty chairs. &quot;What happened to the<br />
  audience?&quot;<br />
  Von Liederkranz's face turned hard. &quot;Dat vas most...<br />
  unfortunate. Dey all refused to confess, und I vas forced to...<br />
  eliminate dem. For vhich...&quot; He looked around quickly. Finding no-<br />
  one else around him, he settled on Ernie. &quot;YOU vill pay,<br />
  schweinhund!&quot; he cried, slapping Ernie with his riding crop.<br />
  &quot;Why me!?&quot; cried Ernie. &quot;I didn't...&quot;<br />
  &quot;SILENCE!&quot;<br />
  Von Liederkranz eyed them all suspiciously. &quot;Unfortunately, I<br />
  vill not be able to interrogate you at de moment, due to a, um,<br />
  temporary staff shortage. Until zis situation can be remedied, I<br />
  vill be forced to keep you locked up. Zis time, however, you vill<br />
  not escape due to ze incompetence of guards! Ze guards have been...<br />
  liquidated.&quot; He smiled evilly. &quot;Now, you vill go behind Door Nummer<br />
  One! MARSCH!&quot; He gestured at them with an evil-looking<br />
  weapon. The foursome found themselves herded through Door Number<br />
  One, which crashed shut behind them with a very loud and ominous<br />
  clang.<br />
  Ernie looked around, his eyes slowly becoming accustomed to<br />
  the darkness. They seemed to be back in the same large dungeon cell<br />
  they had been held in before. The room was dimly lit by a torch<br />
  attached to one wall. The far reaches of the room disappeared into<br />
  the darkness, making it impossible to tell exactly how big the cell<br />
  was.<br />
  &quot;Oh man,&quot; the Fly complained. &quot;Not here again! This place is<br />
  no fun! I waited for my date in here for DAYS, man! She never<br />
  showed up! I couldn't even get a drink while I waited! The service<br />
  in here is terrible!&quot; He peered into the darkness. &quot;Waiter!<br />
  Waiter!&quot; He sighed. &quot;It doesn't do any good. Nobody ever comes!&quot;<br />
  Ernie peered into the darkness. No, he couldn't see anything<br />
  that even remotely resembled a waiter. However, straining his ears,<br />
  he did seem to hear something. It sounded like sniffling, and<br />
  perhaps crying. &quot;Who's there?&quot; he called into the darkness.<br />
  Two small figures began to approach into the light. As they<br />
  approached, Ernie could see that they were children: a little boy<br />
  and a little girl. They were both dressed in German national<br />
  costumes. The girl was wearing a dirndl, and the boy was wearing<br />
  lederhosen and a little alpine hat. They both seemed very sad.<br />
  Ernie was surprised. &quot;Hi there,&quot; he said to the little boy in<br />
  a kindly manner. &quot;What's your name?&quot;<br />
  &quot;My name is Hansel,&quot; said the boy, with a heavy German accent.<br />
  &quot;Und dis is my sister, Gretel.&quot;<br />
  The Fly regarded the children. &quot;Say, you kids haven't seen my<br />
  date, have you? She's about five-foot-two, eyes of blue...&quot; The<br />
  children looked at him uncomprehendingly. The Fly sighed. &quot;Oh well,<br />
  it was worth a try.&quot;<br />
  Ernie regarded the children with amazement. &quot;How did you kids<br />
  get here?&quot;<br />
  Hansel sniffled sadly. &quot;Ve vas arrested by ze Gestapo,&quot; he<br />
  explained. &quot;Ve vas lost in ze forest, und ve found zis gingerbread<br />
  house, und a vicked vitch, und ve push her in ze oven.&quot; Hansel<br />
  sniffled tearfully. &quot;How vas ve to know she vas a Gestapo agent?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Gee, that's tough, kid,&quot; Ernie said sympathetically. He hoped<br />
  Hansel wouldn't cry. He never knew what to do around crying<br />
  children.<br />
  &quot;Well, cheer up, kid,&quot; Captain Memory added in brightly. &quot;It<br />
  could be worse!&quot;<br />
  &quot;How?&quot; asked Hansel innocently.<br />
  &quot;Uh...&quot; Captain Memory thought for a moment. &quot;I'll get back to<br />
  you on that!&quot; He fell silent.<br />
  Hansel whimpered. &quot;It's so cold and dark and awful in here!<br />
  I'm afraid!&quot;<br />
  Ernie winced. `Oh, he's gonna start crying', he thought. `What<br />
  am I gonna do? I don't know what to do when kids cry!' Ernie tried<br />
  to think of something to do. &quot;Uh, cheer up kid! Maybe I'll tell you<br />
  a story!&quot;<br />
  Hansel brightened. &quot;Oh, do you know a good story?&quot;<br />
  Ernie frowned. &quot;Uh, well,...no.&quot; He turned to Captain Memory.<br />
  &quot;Hey, tell these kids a story! You know lots of stories!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Tell us a story! Tell us a story!&quot; The children jumped up and<br />
  down in front of Captain Memory.<br />
  The Captain seemed confused. &quot;Well, uh, I dunno.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh man,&quot; said the Fly. &quot;You're not gonna disappoint these<br />
  poor little kids, are you? Tell 'em something!&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory hesitated. &quot;Well, gee. I don't know what to<br />
  tell them!&quot;<br />
  Hansel jumped up and down excitedly. &quot;Tell us how you travel<br />
  from sector to sector in Cyberspace vithout getting shtopped at ze<br />
  checkpoints! Tell us dat one!&quot;<br />
  Ernie frowned. How did these kids know about that?<br />
  Gretel, too, was jumping up and down excitedly. &quot;Tell us how<br />
  you can JUMP from places dat are not supposed to accept any<br />
  external commands! Tell us dat one!&quot;<br />
  The Captain seemed unsure. &quot;Well, I don't know if I should<br />
  talk about that!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, sure!&quot; said Hansel reassuringly. &quot;You can tell us all<br />
  about it! Dere's no harm in it! Ve're just little kids! You can<br />
  tell us everything you know!&quot;<br />
  &quot;I really shouldn't...&quot; the Captain began.<br />
  &quot;Oh, come on,&quot; Hansel cajoled. &quot;Why not? We're just little<br />
  kids who want to hear a story! We're not midgets, just little kids!<br />
  And,&quot; he laughed. &quot;We're certainly not Gestapo agents!&quot;<br />
  Gretel laughed too. &quot;Oh no, we're not midget Gestapo agents,<br />
  nothing of the kind! How silly to even think such a thing!&quot;<br />
  Hansel gestured at Gretel. &quot;See? Dot proves it! Und ve're<br />
  certainly not trying to pump you for information, ve just vant you<br />
  to tell us a story, ja?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory breathed a sigh of relief. &quot;Well, that's a load<br />
  off my mind!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Gut! Gut!&quot; Hansel and Gretel beamed. &quot;Now, you vill tell us<br />
  vhat ve vant to know, ja?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Sure!&quot; said Captain Memory brightly. &quot;Uh,&quot; he scratched his<br />
  head. &quot;What were we talking about again?&quot;<br />
  Hansel fumed. &quot;Talk, schweinhund! Or else ve...&quot; He noticed<br />
  Gretel glaring at him. He caught himself. &quot;Oh, ja.&quot; He laughed<br />
  feebly. &quot;You vill tell us how you JUMP from place to place, ja?&quot; <br />
  Sterno looked at the children suspiciously. &quot;There's something<br />
  very peculiar about these children,&quot; he remarked. He looked them up<br />
  and down carefully. &quot;You children,&quot; he demanded. &quot;What is your LAST<br />
  NAME?&quot;<br />
  Hansel and Gretel looked at each other in confusion. &quot;Our<br />
  what?&quot;<br />
  &quot;You last name!&quot; Sterno insisted. &quot;Your first names are Hansel<br />
  and Gretel; what are your last names? Even Germans have last<br />
  names!&quot;<br />
  Hansel and Gretel put their heads together and began<br />
  whispering furiously between them. &quot;Last names...Dey didn't give<br />
  us...Vhat do ve say?&quot; Finally, the looked up. &quot;Uh, Colby! Dot's our<br />
  last name! Hansel and Gretel Colby! Ein gut name, ja?&quot;<br />
  Sterno stiffened. &quot;Do you know what that IS!?&quot; he hissed.<br />
  &quot;It's...it's CHEESE! COLBY CHEESE!&quot;<br />
  A look of fury passed over both Hansel and Gretel's faces.<br />
  &quot;Dummkopf!&quot; Gretel screamed at Hansel. &quot;You give away ze whole<br />
  show! Und ve vas zo close!&quot;<br />
  &quot;ME!?&quot; Hansel shrieked back. &quot;It vas you! You pick zis stupid<br />
  name!&quot;<br />
  Suddenly, the door to the dungeon cell flew open. Von<br />
  Liederkranz stood in the doorway, framed in light. &quot;Zo,&quot; he said<br />
  menacingly. &quot;My liddle subterfuge does not fool you, eh? Dot is<br />
  most... unfortunate. Now I vill have to interrogate you meinself.<br />
  Out!&quot; The entire group stepped out of the dungeon cell, and back<br />
  onto the stage of WHEEL OF TORTURE. <br />
  Von Liederkranz turned to Hansel and Gretel. &quot;Und as for YOU,&quot;<br />
  They winced. &quot;Such incompetence is not to be tolerated! You vill<br />
  perhaps step behind Door Nummer Four, ja?&quot;<br />
  The midgets blanched. &quot;NEIN! NEIN! Not Door Nummer Four!&quot;<br />
  &quot;MARSCH!&quot; Von Liederkranz gestured toward the door with his<br />
  evil-looking weapon. The midgets filed sadly through the door,<br />
  which slammed shut behind them. Ernie heard two piercing, blood-<br />
  curdling screams, and then silence.<br />
  Shaken, he turned to Captain Memory. &quot;What...what is behind<br />
  Door Number Four?&quot;<br />
  The Captain shook his head sadly. &quot;You DON'T want to know!&quot;<br />
  Ernie thought for a moment, and decided that probably the<br />
  Captain was right.<br />
  Von Liederkranz smiled evilly. &quot;Und now, ze interrogation! Too<br />
  bad you did not tell ze midgets ze story dey vanted to hear! It<br />
  vould have been much easier... for you!&quot; He stopped, sniffing at<br />
  something in the air. &quot;Vot is dat smell?&quot; he inquired of no-one in<br />
  particular. His eyes lighted on Sterno, whose cigar smoke was<br />
  drifting his way. &quot;Vot are you smoking?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, care for one?&quot; Sterno offered politely. &quot;They're<br />
  Havanas!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Very nice!&quot; Von Liederkranz accepted one. His eyes narrowed.<br />
  &quot;Vhere did you get dese? It takes a special permit to buy dese!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Of course,&quot; Sterno agreed. &quot;You need a Form 1193, `Request<br />
  for Authorization to Apply for a License to Purchase Cigars', and<br />
  you have to have it validated, verified, stamped, sealed, notarized<br />
  and signed; in triplicate, of course. Then you file it, wait for<br />
  your authorization number, and then...&quot;<br />
  &quot;I see!&quot; Von Liederkranz interrupted. Of course, he didn't see<br />
  at all, but listening to this sort of thing gave him a headache.<br />
  &quot;You must be very important, to have such privileges!&quot;<br />
  Sterno puffed himself up proudly. &quot;Well, as a matter of fact,<br />
  I...&quot;<br />
  They were interrupted by a knock at the door. &quot;Who dares to<br />
  interrupt me!?&quot; von Liederkranz fumed.<br />
  &quot;Mailman!&quot; a cheerful voice answered.<br />
  &quot;Vot do you vant?&quot; von Liederkranz answered angrily. The same<br />
  cheerful-looking mailman entered. `How did he get through all those<br />
  locks?' Ernie wondered.<br />
  &quot;I got a letter here for a Mr. Ernest Ross!&quot; <br />
  Ernie waved weakly. &quot;Right here!&quot; The mailman handed Ernie his<br />
  letter, and left.<br />
  Von Liederkranz was livid with rage. &quot;Vhy do you get all ze<br />
  mail?!&quot; he raged. &quot;I myself am avaiting important communications,<br />
  but do I receive zem? No! YOU get all ze mail! Just last veek I vas<br />
  informed dat I may already have won TEN MILLION DOLLARS! Prize<br />
  Notification Central is supposed to contact me any day now! But do<br />
  I hear from zem? NO! I don't even get ze magazines I order from<br />
  zem, either! YOU get all ze mail!&quot; Von Liederkranz raged. &quot;Zis<br />
  makes me very angry! For vhich...&quot; He looked quickly around. His<br />
  eyes lit on the Fly. &quot;YOU vill pay, schweinhund!&quot; He slapped the<br />
  Fly with his riding crop.<br />
  &quot;Hey!&quot; the Fly complained. &quot;It's not my fault! Gimme a break,<br />
  huh?&quot;<br />
  Von Liederkranz smiled evilly. &quot;Vhat vould you like broken?<br />
  Heh, heh!&quot;<br />
  The Fly frowned. &quot;Hey, guys, we gotta think of some other<br />
  phrase to use around here! I don't think it's safe to say `Gimme<br />
  a...'&quot; He looked uneasily at von Liederkranz, who was smirking<br />
  menacingly. &quot;...uh, to say that thing we just said, you know?&quot;<br />
  Ernie opened his letter and read, even though he had a sinking<br />
  feeling that he knew what it was going to say. He was right:</p>
<p>&quot;Dear Mr. Ross,<br />
  We have been retained by the National Bank of the<br />
  West to investigate the matter of an unpaid credit card balance of<br />
  $195,412,771,213,312,032.29. We understand that this account is a<br />
  little over two billion years overdue. Perhaps this matter has<br />
  slipped your mind. Perhaps you think you've got better things to<br />
  do. Well, LISTEN, you lousy DEADBEAT, if we don't get that money by<br />
  noon tomorrow, we're gonna send Vito to collect it! This is gonna<br />
  make Vito very angry! Vito is gonna get this out of you, ONE WAY OR<br />
  THE OTHER, if you get my drift!  So send us this money, PUNK, while<br />
  you still can!</p>
<p>Affectionately,</p>
<p>ACME COLLECTION AGENCY</p>
<p>P.S. If you have already sent in a check for this amount, please<br />
  disregard this letter. Have a nice day!&quot;<br />
  The letter ended with a Smile face.<br />
  Ernie moaned. It was all just getting worse and worse.<br />
  &quot;Give me zat letter!&quot; von Liederkranz tore the letter out of<br />
  Ernie's hand. &quot;Zo, just as ve thought!&quot; he said, reading the letter<br />
  quickly and then tossing it aside. &quot;Zo, you have problems vith<br />
  money, eh?&quot; Ernie nodded, smiling weakly. &quot;I can understand zat,&quot;<br />
  said von Liederkranz commiseratingly. &quot;I, too, have problems vith<br />
  money. In fact, I begin to see, now, vhere some of my problems come<br />
  from!&quot; He pulled out a wicked-looking weapon and held it in Ernie's<br />
  face. &quot;VHAT HAVE YOU DONE VITH MY PRIZE NOTIFICATION?!&quot;<br />
  &quot;ME!?&quot; Ernie began. &quot;I never...&quot;<br />
  &quot;Do not trifle vith me!&quot; von Liederkranz snapped. He held the<br />
  weapon up for Ernie's inspection. &quot;Do you know vhat zis is?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well...&quot; Ernie began.<br />
  &quot;It is a pain generator,&quot; von Liederkranz went on menacingly.<br />
  &quot;You vould like a taste, perhaps?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well...&quot; Ernie began again.<br />
  Von Liederkranz pulled the trigger. Instantly, Ernie's entire<br />
  body was engulfed in intense, searing pain. &quot;YEEOW!&quot;<br />
  VOn Liederkranz smirked evilly. &quot;Ze pain generator has<br />
  intensity settings. Dat vas a number `1'. Ze numbers go up to<br />
  `100'. You vould like to try, perhaps, a `25'?&quot;<br />
  Ernie blanched. All he could think of to say was &quot;Well...&quot;<br />
  There was a knock on the door. &quot;Mailman!&quot;<br />
  &quot;AHA!&quot; Von Liederkranz cried excitedly. &quot;I knew it! ZE PRIZE<br />
  NOTIFICATION!&quot; Von Liederkranz ran to the door and threw it open<br />
  frantically.<br />
  The door flew open, and von Liederkranz froze in horror. &quot;MEIN<br />
  GOTT!&quot; he shrieked. There, an inch outside the door, was a huge<br />
  Post Office dump truck, it's bed lifted, its tailgate open, ready<br />
  to dump. Von Liederkranz had time for only one short scream before<br />
  he was completely engulfed in a huge flood of slick paper<br />
  magazines.<br />
  Captain Memory shook his head sadly. &quot;Poor guy, he should have<br />
  read the fine print. It clearly says that ordering all the<br />
  magazines won't increase your chances to win.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Tough,&quot; Ernie said callously. After his brush with the pain<br />
  generator, he wasn't in the mood to be too sympathetic about<br />
  anything that happened to von Liederkranz. &quot;So, why don't we get<br />
  out of here, okay?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Hmm,&quot; said Captain Memory thoughtfully. &quot;`Out of here', you<br />
  say. Well, that's all well and good, I mean, anybody can just say<br />
  `let's get out of here', but...&quot; He trailed off.<br />
  &quot;Do you have a problem with that?&quot; Ernie wanted to know.<br />
  &quot;Well, um,&quot; said Captain Memory thoughtfully. &quot;I'm not exacly<br />
  sure where we should go next. My last location didn't work out<br />
  quite the way I intended it.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Hoow about the Dead Sea Phonograph Records?&quot; Ernie suggested.<br />
  &quot;Maybe we should go and check them out!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Will you get off that `Dead Sea Phonograph Records'<br />
  business?&quot; Sterno snapped. &quot;That's the most ridiculous thing I've<br />
  heard in...in...&quot; He thought a moment. &quot;...two billion years!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well, have you got a better idea?&quot; Ernie said exasperatedly.<br />
  &quot;Loot, rape, and pillage,&quot; said the Fly thoughtfully.<br />
  &quot;What!?&quot; Ernie didn't know what to make of that statement at<br />
  all.<br />
  &quot;You know,&quot; the Fly continued. &quot;What the Nazi was saying,<br />
  `Loot, rape, and pillage'. It reminds me of something, but I can't<br />
  quite recall what.&quot; The Fly concentrated. &quot;Doesn't it just drive<br />
  you crazy when you can almost think of something, and then, just<br />
  when you think you got it, it gets away from you?&quot;<br />
  &quot;I know what you mean,&quot; said Ernie sympathetically.<br />
  &quot;Let me see now,&quot; said Captain Memory reflectively. He seemed<br />
  to be taking the Fly's problem very seriously. &quot;That was: Rape,<br />
  Loot and Pillage?&quot;<br />
  Sterno frowned. &quot;I don't think that's right.&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory looked surprised. &quot;What's wrong with it? It's<br />
  not a song title, is it?&quot;<br />
  &quot;No.&quot; Sterno thought a moment. &quot;It could be a heavy-metal rock<br />
  song. But I don't think it is.&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory breathed a sigh of relief. &quot;Well, that's one<br />
  less thing to worry about!&quot; He fell silent; he seemed to be lost in<br />
  thought.<br />
  Sterno continued. &quot;I think it's supposed to be `loot, pillage,<br />
  and rape'.&quot;<br />
  The Fly considered this. &quot;`Loot, pillage, rape', not `loot,<br />
  rape, pillage'?&quot;<br />
  &quot;How about `pillage, rape, loot'?&quot; Ernie chimed in.<br />
  The others glared at him. &quot;Don't be ridiculous!&quot; Sterno<br />
  snapped. <br />
  &quot;Attila the Hun!&quot; the Fly cried excitedly.<br />
  &quot;What?!&quot; Ernie said exasperatedly. &quot;What in the world does<br />
  that have to do with anything?&quot;<br />
  &quot;That's what I was trying to think of!&quot; The Fly was jubilant.<br />
  &quot;Boy, do I feel better!&quot; He turned to Captain Memory. &quot;Hey, it was<br />
  Attila the Hun!&quot;<br />
  The Captain seemed to have sunk into a reverie. The Fly's<br />
  comment seemed to suddenly startle him out of it. &quot;What? Oh, Attila<br />
  the Hun? Well, I guess. I can't think of anything better!&quot; <br />
  Ernie didn't like the sound of this. &quot;Wait a minute! What...&quot;<br />
  But it was too late. <br />
  &quot;0028 CE 21!&quot; Captain Memory cried. The scene vanished.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> CHAPTER 6</p>
<p> The foursome found themselves standing on a grassy hill. In<br />
  this distance a column of smoke rose heavenward from a village that<br />
  was being pillaged - possibly looted and raped as well (it was too<br />
  far to see).<br />
  &quot;There you go, guys,&quot; said Captain Memory cheerfully. &quot;Attila<br />
  the Hun! Now what?&quot;<br />
  &quot;What do you mean, `Now what?'?&quot; Ernie demanded. &quot;If you don't<br />
  know what we're going to do here, then why did you bring us here?&quot;<br />
  &quot;I thought you wanted to come here!&quot; Captain Memory protested.<br />
  &quot;It wasn't my idea! I was just trying to be nice! Actually, I<br />
  thought it was kind of a weird thing to do. I mean, we could have<br />
  gone to Vegas, we could have gone to Hawaii, but no, you want to go<br />
  see Attila the Hun!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well, whose idea was it, then?&quot; Ernie wanted to know.<br />
  &quot;Well, it certainly wasn't MY idea!&quot; Sterno demurred.<br />
  They all looked at the Fly. He shifted uncomfortably. &quot;Hey, I<br />
  was just making conversation, you know? I didn't mean we should<br />
  actually come and SEE Attila the Hun. I don't even know the guy,<br />
  you know?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory chuckled. &quot;How about that! We came all the way<br />
  to ancient Rome, and nobody really wanted to go at all! Funny how<br />
  things work out, isn't it? Well, I guess we'll just have to make<br />
  the best of it!&quot;</p>
<p> Ernie looked out across the fields. &quot;How can we be in anciant<br />
  Rome, anyway?&quot; he asked.<br />
  &quot;Educational software,&quot; the Captain explained. &quot;THE HISTORY OF<br />
  THE WORLD database. All the schools have it.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh.&quot; Ernie looked down. He noticed they were standing on a<br />
  road. He would have assumed it was one of the famous Roman Roads,<br />
  except that it was made of yellow brick. Ernie was almost certain<br />
  that the Romans didn't build their roads out of yellow bricks, but<br />
  he decided not to say anything about it, just in case he was wrong.<br />
  He was sick of being made fun of.<br />
  &quot;I wonder where this road leads,&quot; Ernie speculated.<br />
  &quot;Rome,&quot; Sterno answered with certainty.<br />
  &quot;How do you know?&quot; Ernie was skeptical.<br />
  &quot;Everybody knows that,&quot; Sterno answered with authority. &quot;`All<br />
  Roads Lead to Rome'!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Hey, that'll be fun!&quot; the Fly chimed in. &quot;Maybe we can get<br />
  togas! Maybe we can have a Toga party!&quot; He started chanting. &quot;Toga!<br />
  Toga! Toga!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Yeah, maybe we can get shot full of arrows by the Huns, too,&quot;<br />
  Ernie added glumly.<br />
  They began walking down the yellow brick road. In the distance<br />
  a pall of smoke rose from nearby pillaged villages. &quot;Hey, there's<br />
  a building up ahead!&quot; the Fly observed.<br />
  They walked nearer. &quot;Oh, it's a Roman villa! They're supposed<br />
  to be very luxurious! Let's take a look at it!&quot;<br />
  Ernie was doubtful. &quot;What if it's been pillaged?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Don't be ridiculous!&quot; Sterno snapped. &quot;It's a `villa', not a<br />
  `village'! You can't very well pillage a `villa'! It doesn't even<br />
  rhyme!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh...sorry,&quot; Ernie felt like he just couldn't stop making<br />
  mistakes.<br />
  &quot;They education they give young people these days!&quot; Sterno<br />
  sniffed. &quot;It's just a disgrace! Whatever happened to the classical<br />
  education? Where I come from, EVERYONE who is ANYONE has a<br />
  classical education!&quot;<br />
  &quot;I don't have a classical education,&quot; the Fly commented.<br />
  &quot;My point exactly,&quot; Sterno smirked.<br />
  The Fly frowned. &quot;Hey, are you putting me down or something?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, perish forbid,&quot; said Sterno sneeringly. &quot;Far be it from<br />
  me to put you down, when you do such a wonderful job of it<br />
  yourself!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, uh...thanks.&quot; The Fly seemed confused. He brightened.<br />
  &quot;Say, do you suppose there'll be any beautiful harem girls in that<br />
  villa?&quot;<br />
  Sterno looked disgusted. &quot;This is ROME! They don't have harems<br />
  in ROME! Only the Arabs have harems!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Aww.&quot; The Fly seemed deeply disappointed.<br />
  A thought occurred to Ernie. &quot;Hey, this is ancient Rome!&quot;<br />
  &quot;You just noticed that?&quot; Sterno said sarcastically.<br />
  &quot;I'll bet this has something to do with the Dead Sea<br />
  Phonograph Records!&quot;<br />
  Sterno sighed disgustedly. &quot;Will you PLEASE get off that Dead<br />
  Sea Phonograph Records business? You are the only person I know who<br />
  organizes their entire life around articles in sensational<br />
  tabloids! Why can't you worry about something serious, like alien<br />
  Elvis clones?&quot;<br />
  A serious look came over Ernie's face. &quot;Do you suppose I<br />
  should?&quot;<br />
  Sterno sighed again. &quot;Hopeless!&quot;<br />
  They approached the villa. A large white marble porch, held up<br />
  by Roman columns, greeted them. Ernie noticed something moving in<br />
  the shadows nearby. <br />
  The Fly peered at it. &quot;Oh, it's a horse!&quot; he exclaimed.<br />
  The horse walked towards them out of the shadows. Ernie saw it<br />
  was a good-sized palomino, well-groomed, wearing a bridle.<br />
  Something looked a bit odd about it, but in this light Ernie<br />
  couldn't tell what it was. But then, he didn't really know that<br />
  much about horses anyway.<br />
  The horse approached them.  &quot;Hi there!&quot; the horse said in a<br />
  deep, drawling voice.<br />
  Sterno started. &quot;A talking horse!&quot;<br />
  The horse started. &quot;A talking dog!&quot;<br />
  Ernie sighed. &quot;A talking horse, right. I guess I might have<br />
  expected something like that. What next?&quot; There was a time when all<br />
  of this would have seemed very unusual to him, perhaps even<br />
  startling. Now, however, it was getting kind of routine. <br />
  The horse regained its composure. &quot;Say, have any of you guys<br />
  seen my friend Wilbur around here?&quot;<br />
  The Fly regarded the horse carefully. &quot;You know, this horse<br />
  looks very familiar. That voice sounds familiar, too.&quot;<br />
  The horse tossed his mane. &quot;Oh, maybe you've seen my TV show.<br />
  My name is Mr. Ed!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Sure!&quot; cried the Fly gleefully. &quot;I used to love that show!&quot;<br />
  He began to sing. &quot;A horse is a horse, of course, of course...&quot;<br />
  &quot;Will you please stop singing that stupid song?&quot; snapped<br />
  Sterno irritatedly. &quot;I've always hated that song!&quot;<br />
  &quot;You don't like the theme song?&quot; asked Mr. Ed incredulously.<br />
  &quot;But everybody likes the theme song! It's one of the most popular<br />
  parts of the show!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well, I don't!&quot; Sterno barked.<br />
  Mr. Ed pawed the ground. &quot;Well, I guess that's all you can<br />
  expect from a talking dog!&quot;<br />
  Sterno glared. &quot;Where I come from, we grind up animals like<br />
  you and feed them to our pet humans!&quot;<br />
  Mr. Ed whinnied. &quot;Let's not get personal, now!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Hmmph!&quot; Sterno fell silent.<br />
  &quot;Well...&quot; said the Fly hesitantly. &quot;I liked the theme song!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Thank you,&quot; said Mr. Ed. &quot;I'm glad somebody here has some<br />
  taste.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Gee, it's really neat to actually meet Mr. Ed,&quot; the Fly<br />
  enthused. &quot;You know, I always thought your voice was, like, a<br />
  special effect or something.&quot;<br />
  &quot;A what?&quot; asked the horse.<br />
  &quot;You know, like dubbed or something,&quot; the Fly explained. &quot;I<br />
  mean, I thought you weren't really talking.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Why would you think a thing like that?&quot; Mr. Ed wondered.<br />
  A thought occurred to Ernie. &quot;Say, Mr. Ed,&quot; he said to the<br />
  horse. &quot;What are you doing in ancient Rome, anyway?&quot;<br />
  Mr. Ed tossed his mane. &quot;You know,&quot; he said thoughtfully. &quot;I<br />
  was just asking myself that very question!&quot;<br />
  Ernie narrowed his eyes suspiciously. That didn't seem to be<br />
  a very satisfactory answer to him.<br />
  &quot;Let's go inside, shall we?&quot; suggested Sterno. &quot;The smoke from<br />
  that burning village is bothering my sinuses.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Good idea!&quot; said Mr. Ed, and led the way.<br />
  They crossed the Roman-style marble porch, walked through an<br />
  open atrium with a gurgling fountain in the middle of it, and came<br />
  to a huge oak door covered with iron studs. Inside, was a 1950's<br />
  style suburban living room, complete with blond furniture and a<br />
  free-form coffee table.<br />
  Ernie frowned. &quot;You know, somehow this looks out of place to<br />
  me.&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory sighed. &quot;Now THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD database<br />
  is all screwed up, too. Somebody's teacher's gonna be really mad<br />
  about this!&quot;<br />
  Ernie continued to frown. &quot;You notice that we come across an<br />
  awful lot of fifties-type stuff? How come we don't get forties<br />
  stuff, or seventies stuff? How come it's always fifties stuff?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory sighed, and dropped heavily into the green<br />
  fifties-style sofa. &quot;Oh, I'm sure there's a logical explanation for<br />
  it. I just can't think of it at the moment.&quot;<br />
  Mr. Ed pawed the ground nervously. &quot;Say, you're not suspicious<br />
  or anything, are you? There's nothing to be suspicious of!<br />
  Everything's perfectly safe!&quot; Somehow, this reassurance failed to<br />
  make Ernie feel any better.<br />
  Mr. Ed pointed his muzzle towards a large, floor model,<br />
  fifties-style television set. &quot;Say, you wanna watch some TV?&quot;<br />
  &quot;NO!&quot; Ernie was not ready to cope with any more TV.<br />
  Mr. Ed seemed taken aback. &quot;You don't have to shout,&quot; he said<br />
  in a hurt tone, clopping off to the other side of the room.<br />
  &quot;Aww, now you hurt his feelings!&quot; said the Fly accusingly. He<br />
  set off to try to console Mr. Ed.<br />
  Captain Memory was pulling some objects out of hidden pockets<br />
  in his costume. &quot;Ah, here it is!&quot; he said, producing his favorite<br />
  item, the TV Guide.<br />
  Ernie felt his stomach grumbling. He was getting really<br />
  hungry by now. He hadn't gotten anything to eat back at the<br />
  gingerbread cottage, when the others were stuffing their faces. He<br />
  was beginning to really regret that now. He noticed an open door at<br />
  the other end of the living room, and decided to go and investigate<br />
  it.<br />
  Through the door was a typical suburban kitchen. His eyes<br />
  immediately fixed on one object: the refrigerator. He threw it open<br />
  excitedly. Unfortunately, it was empty, except for a box of baking<br />
  soda. Maybe there would be something in the freezer? Ernie opened<br />
  the freezer door, and started back in horror. There, frozen into<br />
  immobility, was the most hideous, disgusting, totally alien<br />
  monstrosity that Ernie had ever seen. One of it's tentacles, or<br />
  pseudopods, or whatever they were, was frozen into the ice cube<br />
  tray. Another seemed to be reaching for a box of popsicles. Ernie's<br />
  stomach turned over, and he slammed the freezer door in disgust.<br />
  Ernie ran back into the living room. &quot;There's the most awful<br />
  thing in the freezer!&quot; he exclaimed excitedly.<br />
  &quot;Oh yeah?&quot; Captain Memory wasn't actually paying attention.<br />
  &quot;Yeah!&quot; Ernie went on agitatedly. &quot;It's some kind of weird,<br />
  alien thing, and it's frozen into the ice cube tray!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, yes,&quot; Sterno commented calmly. &quot;Aliens in the ice cube<br />
  trays. We get them all the time. Rather a nuisance. Unsanitary,<br />
  don't you know.&quot;<br />
  &quot;What?!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Must you always shout?&quot; Sterno said reprovingly. &quot;I have very<br />
  delicate hearing, you know.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, um, sorry,&quot; Ernie was embarrassed. Apparently no-one<br />
  seemed to consider the alien very important.<br />
  Sterno thought a moment. &quot;Were there, by any chance, some<br />
  popsicles in that refrigerator?&quot;<br />
  Ernie was surprised. &quot;Uh, yeah, there were. How did you know<br />
  that?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, yes,&quot; Sterno continued. &quot;They're always found with<br />
  popsicles, you know. That's why they come to Earth, we believe. To<br />
  steal popsicles. But then, they accidentally step into the ice cube<br />
  tray in the &quot;Quick Chill&quot; section, and get frozen stiff.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Wasn't that a movie?&quot; the Fly chimed in, momentarily breaking<br />
  off his conversation with Mr. Ed.<br />
  The word &quot;movie&quot; caught Captain Memory's attention. &quot;Oh yeah?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Sure,&quot; the Fly went on enthusiastically. &quot;I remember that<br />
  now. `THE THING'! It was a '50's science fiction movie about this<br />
  alien frozen into the ice at the North Pole.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Great movie!&quot; Captain Memory agreed. &quot;With James Arness as<br />
  the Thing!&quot;<br />
  &quot;I thought James Arness was Marshall Matt Dillon on<br />
  `Gunsmoke',&quot; said the Fly, puzzled.<br />
  &quot;Mmm hmm,&quot; Captain Memory agreed. &quot;But he was also the alien.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Imagine that!&quot; the Fly shook his head wonderingly. &quot;Marshall<br />
  Matt Dillon was an alien! No wonder he was so quick on the draw!&quot;<br />
  Ernie fidgeted anxiously. &quot;So, what should I do about it?&quot;<br />
  &quot;About what?&quot; Sterno asked, only half paying attention.<br />
  &quot;The ALIEN!&quot; Ernie cried.<br />
  &quot;Please!&quot; winced Sterno, putting his paws over his ears.<br />
  &quot;Oh. Sorry.&quot; Ernie lowered his voice.<br />
  &quot;That's better,&quot; Sterno lowered his paws. &quot;Just don't thaw it<br />
  out.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Leave it?&quot;<br />
  &quot;DON'T thaw it out!&quot; Sterno repeated emphatically.<br />
  Ernie considered this. &quot;Why would aliens steal popsicles?&quot; he<br />
  wondered.<br />
  &quot;Because they haven't any money, I suppose,&quot; Sterno mused.<br />
  &quot;They can't buy them if they haven't any money, now can they? I<br />
  suppose they'll just have to steal them, then!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Uh...&quot; Ernie felt unsatisfied by this line of reasoning.<br />
  &quot;They can't very well just go out and get jobs, now can they?&quot;<br />
  Sterno continued. &quot;After all, who'd hire an alien? McDonalds? Would<br />
  you really want to buy a hamburger from an alien?&quot;<br />
  Ernie thought about the frozen alien, and his stomach flipped<br />
  over again. &quot;Um, no...&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well, that proves it, then!&quot; Sterno leaned back triumphantly.<br />
  Ernie sighed, and sat down on the sofa. The others all seemed<br />
  absorbed in their own pursuits. Ernie fidgeted uncomfortably. His<br />
  stomach growled. He was beginning to get ravenously hungry. He<br />
  looked at the kitchen door. Maybe he could try the kitchen one more<br />
  time.<br />
  The kitchen looked a lot like something out of a 1950's<br />
  `Better Homes &amp; Gardens' magazine. It was painted in cheerful<br />
  colors, with cast-iron trivets hanging on the walls as decorations.<br />
  Ernie would have found it quite homey, if he hadn't known that<br />
  there was a Thing in the freezer. Avoiding the refrigerator, he<br />
  walked over to a row of cabinets and began rummaging through them.<br />
  The contents of the cabinets turned out to be disappointing.<br />
  There were none of Ernie's favorite foods. He looked through the<br />
  containers. `Hearts of Toad'? No. `Poisonberry Yogurt?' I don't<br />
  think so. What's this? Ernie grabbed a box of what appeared to be<br />
  peanut brittle. `Great!' he thought. `I love peanut brittle!' He<br />
  was just about to tear into it, when he noticed the label:<br />
  `Cockroach Crunch'. He put it back gingerly. He decided that<br />
  perhaps he wasn't all that hungry after all.<br />
  Ernie was just about to give up and go back into the living<br />
  room, when he noticed a familiar-looking object on the counter<br />
  nearby. He looked at it more closely. It seemed to be an old<br />
  1950's-style coffee maker. It seemed to Ernie that he could sure<br />
  use a cup of coffee right now.  He examined it more closely. `Hey!<br />
  This is Bakelite! Genuine Bakelite! This must be one of the first<br />
  coffee makers ever made! What a treasure! Plastic collectors would<br />
  pay a fortune for this!' He picked it up and carried it into the<br />
  living room.<br />
  &quot;Hey, guys!&quot; Ernie announced. &quot;Look what I found!&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory started as he saw what Ernie was carrying.<br />
  &quot;Wow! Where'd you get that?&quot;<br />
  Ernie was excited. &quot;It was just sitting on the counter in the<br />
  kitchen!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Do you know what that is?&quot; Captain Memory enthused. &quot;That's<br />
  a Psion Megaforce Generator! I wonder what it's doing on this<br />
  planet?&quot;<br />
  Ernie's heart sank. &quot;Does this mean I'm not going to get a cup<br />
  of coffee?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory continued to enthuse. &quot;Wow! A Psion Megaforce<br />
  Generator! Right here! Right in our own living room!&quot;<br />
  Sterno, who, up to this point had not been paying any<br />
  attention, looked up irritatedly. &quot;What? What kind of nonsense are<br />
  you going on about now?&quot;<br />
  &quot;It's a Psion Megaforce Generator! I can't believe it!&quot; The<br />
  Captain seemed really enraptured by it.<br />
  &quot;I just can't tell you how thrilled I am about that,&quot; Sterno<br />
  yawned. &quot;Or rather, I could, but I'd rather not be impolite. So,<br />
  instead, why don't you just tell us what this thing is supposed to<br />
  be?&quot;<br />
  &quot;It's a Psion Megaforce Generator!&quot; The Captain was, indeed,<br />
  very excited.<br />
  Sterno sighed. &quot;Okay. We understand that. Now, why don't you<br />
  just calm down, and tell us what it's supposed to do.&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory seemed taken aback. &quot;Do?&quot;<br />
  Sterno spoke each word slowly and carefully, as though talking<br />
  to a small child. &quot;What is it supposed to do?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory shifted uncomfortably. &quot;Hmmm, lemme think. Uh,<br />
  I used to know that. I used to know all that stuff...&quot;<br />
  Sterno repeated himself, speaking even more slowly and<br />
  carefully, as though to someone who did not speak English very<br />
  well. &quot;What is it supposed to do?&quot;<br />
  Ernie examined the device. He turned to Captain Memory. &quot;Are<br />
  you sure this thing is really a Psion Megaforce Generator?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, absolutely!&quot; The Captain looked very relieved that<br />
  someone had broken the awkward silence.<br />
  &quot;Then how come it says `Mr. Coffee' on it?&quot;<br />
  &quot;It's a `Mr. Coffee' brand Psion Megaforce Generator. What's<br />
  wrong with that?&quot; the Captain wanted to know.<br />
  Ernie was becoming more and more skeptical. &quot;So, how come it<br />
  says `makes 1-4 cups. Drip grind only'?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well, uh, I'm sure there's a logical explanation for that,&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory said evasively. &quot;I just can't quite think of it at<br />
  the moment.&quot;<br />
  Ernie narrowed his eyes suspiciously. &quot;Are you sure this isn't<br />
  a coffee maker?&quot; <br />
  &quot;Uh...&quot; Captain Memory stopped. Suddenly, his eyes lit up.<br />
  &quot;I've got it! NOW I remember! Of course, why didn't I think of it?<br />
  Now I remember what a Psion Megaforce Generator is supposed to do!&quot;<br />
  Sterno was not impressed. &quot;Okay. What?&quot;<br />
  &quot;It makes coffee!&quot; Captain Memory cried out triumphantly.<br />
  Ernie set the coffee maker on the table and sat down on the<br />
  sofa, rubbing his head wearily. Why did everything always have to<br />
  be so complicated?<br />
  Captain Memory looked around at everyone, obviously<br />
  disappointed. Sterno was pointedly looking in another direction.<br />
  The Fly was talking to Mr. Ed. Ernie was wearily cradling his head<br />
  in his hands. No-one seemed to be greeting the Captain's<br />
  announcement with much enthusiasm.<br />
  &quot;Of course, I could be wrong,&quot; The Captain said tentatively.<br />
  No-one answered.<br />
  Ernie began examining the coffee maker. He wasn't quite sure<br />
  how to work an old model like this. He turned it over. There seemed<br />
  to be some directions on the bottom, but the were all covered with<br />
  coffee stains, and were practically impossible to read. He would<br />
  probably just have to figure it out himself.<br />
  &quot;Wait a minute!&quot; The Captain said urgently.<br />
  Ernie looked up. &quot;Now what?&quot;<br />
  &quot;It just occurred to me that, uh,&quot; Captain Memory looked<br />
  embarrassed. &quot;Maybe the Psion Megaforce Generator doesn't make<br />
  coffee after all.&quot;<br />
  &quot;So what does it do instead? Make tea?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Um, no.&quot; The Captain looked uncomfortable. &quot;I think it, uh,<br />
  destroys planets.&quot;<br />
  Ernie gave the Captain a disgusted look.<br />
  &quot;There, uh, isn't any place to put peanut butter in that<br />
  thing, is there?&quot; the Captain asked intensely.<br />
  Ernie examined it. &quot;No.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Nothing about peanut butter? No little door, or compartment<br />
  or anything?&quot;<br />
  Ernie looked it over. &quot;Nope.&quot;<br />
  The Captain seemed relieved. &quot;Okay, okay. Forget that. Forget<br />
  I said anything about peanut butter. I'm absolutely sure that it,<br />
  uh, destroys planets. Or makes coffee. It for sure either destroys<br />
  planets or makes coffee!&quot; Captain Memory beamed, pleased with<br />
  himself for having solved this difficult problem.<br />
  Ernie examined the machine more closely. There was a lever on<br />
  the top which was labelled `Mild' on one side, and `Full' on the<br />
  other. He also found a two-position switch on the side. There were<br />
  little words printed next to each position. Unfortunately, the ink<br />
  had rubbed off of them, and they were very difficult to read. Ernie<br />
  peered closely. He wasn't sure, but the positions seemed to be<br />
  labelled &quot;Brew&quot; and &quot;Destroy.&quot;  Ernie sighed. He was rapidly losing<br />
  interest in the entire subject. Idly, he flipped the switch.<br />
  Instantly, the earth rumbled, the building shook. Ernie<br />
  hastily flipped the switch back again.<br />
  Sterno turned to Ernie irritatedly. &quot;Who did that? Did you do<br />
  that?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Uh, yeah, I...&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well, you could at least excuse yourself!&quot; Sterno snapped.<br />
  &quot;Oh. Sorry.&quot; Somehow, Ernie always seemed to wind up feeling<br />
  that he was at fault.<br />
  Captain Memory was beaming. &quot;Well, that settles that, doesn't<br />
  it? It destroys planets! I was right all along! Of course I was!&quot;<br />
  Ernie regarded the device ruefully. He noticed a small, faded<br />
  tag on the side which read &quot;WARNING: Follow instructions carefully.<br />
  The manufacturer assumes no responsibility for damage to planets<br />
  due to failure to follow said instructions. Such failure will also<br />
  void your warranty.&quot; Ernie sighed. &quot;There goes my cup of coffee.&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory returned to consulting his TV Guide. An object<br />
  on the coffee table caught Ernie's attention. It was a small<br />
  rectangular object wrapped in paper. He picked it up. It seemed to<br />
  be a candy bar. Ernie's stomach started grumbling again. He was<br />
  feeling very sorry for himself at the moment. He hadn't had<br />
  anything to eat for a very long time. How come everybody else got<br />
  to eat, but not him? He couldn't even get a cup of coffee! He<br />
  unwrapped the object. It looked like a candy bar. It smelled like<br />
  a candy bar. A wave of guilt suddenly came over him. He probably<br />
  shouldn't eat it. It probably belonged to Captain Memory. But then,<br />
  on the other hand, maybe it had been on the coffee table all along,<br />
  and he just hadn't noticed it. Ernie brightened. In any case, that<br />
  sounded like a good excuse to him. He took a bite. Quite tasty,<br />
  although it did have an odd crunch. He ate the rest of the bar, and<br />
  tossed the wrapper under the sofa.<br />
  Ernie was beginning to feel somewhat better. Suddenly, the<br />
  telephone rang. Ernie looked at Captain Memory. Captain Memory<br />
  looked at Ernie. &quot;Well?&quot; the Captain demanded.<br />
  &quot;Uh, the telephone's ringing,&quot; said Ernie uncomfortably.<br />
  &quot;Are you going to answer it?&quot; the Captain wanted to know.<br />
  &quot;Um, you want me to answer it?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well, it's on your side!&quot; It was, indeed, sitting on an end<br />
  table right next to Ernie.<br />
  &quot;I thought they didn't have telephones in ancient Rome,&quot; said<br />
  Ernie uneasily.<br />
  &quot;For god's sake, answer the telephone already!&quot; cried Sterno.<br />
  &quot;That ringing is driving me crazy!&quot;<br />
  Ernie picked up the phone. &quot;Yo!&quot; cried the voice on the other<br />
  end. &quot;Ernie Ross, right?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Uh, yeah,&quot; answered Ernie uneasily. He wasn't expecting to<br />
  get any calls in ancient Rome.<br />
  &quot;Dis is Vito. We got a little matter to discuss about<br />
  a...uh...$195,412,771,213,312,032.29, PLUS INTEREST, you know what<br />
  I mean? We're gonna get dis money, you know what I mean? So, uh,<br />
  are you gonna make it easy on yourself and give it to us now, or<br />
  are we gonna have to get it outta you, like, da hard way?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well, look, I got this problem...&quot;Ernie began desperately.<br />
  &quot;You tink you gotta problem now,&quot; Vito interrupted. &quot;It ain't<br />
  nothin' compared to the problem you gonna have if you don't pay<br />
  up!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well...&quot;Ernie tried again.<br />
  &quot;Look!&quot; Vito broke in. &quot;I'm comin to get da money, punk, and<br />
  you better have it, OR ELSE!&quot; He hung up.<br />
  Ernie turned to Captain Memory. &quot;Maybe we should go someplace<br />
  else,&quot; he suggested.<br />
  &quot;Okay,&quot; said the Captain agreeably. &quot;Where?&quot;<br />
  Ernie concentrated. &quot;I know!&quot; he said brightly. &quot;How about we<br />
  go to the Middle East and look for the Dead Sea Phonograph<br />
  Records?&quot;<br />
  Sterno moaned. &quot;Not THAT again!&quot;<br />
  The Captain looked doubtful. &quot;It's kind of a long walk!&quot;<br />
  Ernie frowned. &quot;Can't you just transport us there?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well, you know, I don't really like to do that too often,&quot;<br />
  answered the Captain. &quot;There's always a certain amount of risk.<br />
  With these locations changing all the time, there's always a chance<br />
  of a FATAL ERROR creeping in, and...&quot;<br />
  &quot;Okay, okay,&quot; said Ernie quickly. &quot;Forget I said it, okay?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Have it your way&quot;, said the Captain agreeably.<br />
  Ernie sighed. All of this was just too much for him. &quot;If only<br />
  we had some kind of vehicle or something. A spaceship, or even a<br />
  car!&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory looked thoughtful. &quot;Oh, you want a spaceship?&quot;<br />
  &quot;You have a SPACESHIP?&quot; Ernie cried.<br />
  &quot;Well, it's just a little something I take out on the<br />
  weekends,&quot; the Captain explained modestly. &quot;It's no big deal. I<br />
  mean, it doesn't have a kitchen, or a porta-john or anything. It's<br />
  just for short hops, like around the solar system or something.<br />
  It's called the Luna C.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Lunacy?&quot; Sterno inquired.<br />
  &quot;Oh, no,&quot; Captain Memory laughed. The Luna C.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Why C?&quot; Ernie was curious.<br />
  &quot;Well, you know, after the Luna A and the Luna B, there's the<br />
  Luna C!&quot; Captain Memory explained.<br />
  &quot;So, what happened to the Luna A and the Luna B?&quot; Sterno<br />
  wanted to know.<br />
  Captain Memory suddenly became very quiet. After a few<br />
  moments, he muttered &quot;Well...well...it wasn't my fault!&quot;<br />
  Ernie frowned. &quot;What wasn't?&quot;<br />
  &quot;It was a stupid place to put a planet anyway!&quot; Captain Memory<br />
  went on, suddenly indignant. &quot;I mean, how was I supposed to know<br />
  there was a planet in that sector! Nobody would've expected a<br />
  planet to be in that sector!&quot;<br />
  &quot;A planet?&quot; Ernie asked incredulously.<br />
  &quot;Well, okay, okay,&quot; Captain Memory continued defensively.<br />
  &quot;Maybe I was a little way out of the spacelane. It could happen to<br />
  anybody! A couple of light-years this way or that...&quot;<br />
  &quot;A couple of light years?&quot; Sterno inquired.<br />
  &quot;Okay, okay,&quot; Captain Memory seemed very ill-at-ease. &quot;So<br />
  maybe I had a couple of drinks. Big deal! I mean, I was at a party,<br />
  right? What do you want me to do, just stand around all night?<br />
  Okay, so maybe I shouldn't have been doing Warp 9 in a Warp 3 zone.<br />
  So I made a little mistake. Big deal! I mean, what am I supposed to<br />
  do, pay for this the rest of my life, or what?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Let me get this straight,&quot; Sterno said. &quot;You hit a planet at<br />
  Warp 9?&quot;<br />
  &quot;It was a stupid place to put a planet,&quot; Captain Memory<br />
  repeated petulantly. &quot;It should've had a guard rail, or something.&quot;<br />
  &quot;So what happened?&quot; Ernie asked incredulously.<br />
  &quot;Oh,&quot; Captain Memory looked at the ground. &quot;I hadda pay for<br />
  it.&quot;<br />
  &quot;You had to pay for a PLANET?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well, I had insurance...&quot; the Captain said brightly. &quot;Um,<br />
  that is, I had insurance...&quot; He trailed off.<br />
  Sterno caught the drift. &quot;You don't have insurance any more?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory looked very uncomfortable. &quot;Well, my premiums<br />
  kind of went up...&quot;<br />
  Sterno thought for a moment. &quot;You said there was a Luna A and<br />
  a Luna B. That accounts for one of them. What happened to the other<br />
  one?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory fidgeted. &quot;Can't we talk about something else?&quot;<br />
  Sterno rolled his eyes upward. &quot;So, are you going to be flying<br />
  this spaceship?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well, uh, no...&quot; the Captain began.<br />
  &quot;Thank Heavens!&quot; Sterno broke in.<br />
  &quot;I would, I mean, I could,&quot; Captain Memory continued. &quot;Just as<br />
  soon as I get my license back...&quot;<br />
  Sterno sighed. &quot;So, what are we supposed to do, wait?&quot;<br />
  &quot;No, no,&quot; the Captain said reassuringly. &quot;They gave me a<br />
  pilot.&quot;<br />
  Sterno breathed a sigh of relief.<br />
  &quot;So, where is  this spaceship?&quot; Ernie asked excitedly. He was<br />
  really looking forward to the prospect of seeing a real live<br />
  spaceship.<br />
  &quot;I left it parked up in orbit,&quot; the Captain explained. &quot;Want<br />
  me to call it down?&quot;<br />
  &quot;SURE!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Okay.&quot; The Captain began looking around. &quot;Where's my remote<br />
  control? I had it here a minute ago!&quot;<br />
  Ernie began looking around as well. &quot;What does it look like?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, it's about so,&quot; Captain Memory motioned with his hands to<br />
  indicated a rectangle about six inches long. &quot;It's wrapped in white<br />
  paper.&quot;<br />
  Ernie began to feel uneasy. &quot;What color was it? Under the<br />
  paper, that is?&quot;<br />
  The Captain was still looking around. &quot;It's brown, and kind of<br />
  soft.&quot; The Captain looked under the sofa. &quot;That's funny. Here's the<br />
  paper from it, but it's all crumpled up! And the remote is gone!&quot;<br />
  Ernie began to get a real bad feeling in the pit of his<br />
  stomach. &quot;Um, was it, by any chance, uh, chocolate?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well, sure! After all, it was either that or strawberry!&quot; The<br />
  Captain laughed. &quot;I couldn't very well have a strawberry remote,<br />
  could I?&quot;<br />
  Ernie moaned quietly. &quot;Uh, I think I know what happened to<br />
  it.&quot;<br />
  Sterno looked at Ernie, aghast. &quot;You DIDN'T!&quot;<br />
  Ernie nodded sadly.<br />
  Sterno turned to Captain Memory. &quot;He ATE it!&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory looked at Ernie incredulously. &quot;How could you<br />
  EAT a remote control unit?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well...&quot; Ernie was embarrassed. &quot;Actually, it was pretty<br />
  good!&quot; Suddenly, a disturbing thought occurred to him. &quot;Say, it's<br />
  not poison or anything, is it?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory looked thoughtful. &quot;I don't know, nobody's ever<br />
  eaten one before.&quot; He thought a moment. &quot;I guess we'll find out,<br />
  won't we?&quot;<br />
  Ernie moaned quietly. &quot;Well...well...If they're gonna make a<br />
  remote control unit that looks like a candy bar, they ought to put<br />
  a warning on it or something!&quot;<br />
  &quot;They did,&quot; Captain Memory answered.<br />
  &quot;I didn't see any warning!&quot; cried Ernie indignantly. &quot;All I<br />
  saw was a piece of blank white paper!&quot;<br />
  &quot;That's the warning,&quot; the Captain explained. &quot;It means `Don't<br />
  Eat this Remote Control Unit' in Franglian.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Franglian?&quot;<br />
  &quot;You know, like they speak on the planet Franglia?&quot; Captain<br />
  Memory acted as though this were perfectly obvious to everyone.<br />
  &quot;But nobody on Earth speaks Franglian!&quot; Ernie protested.<br />
  Captain Memory considered this. &quot;Well, then I guess it's not<br />
  much good, is it?&quot;  He pulled out his TV Guide. &quot;Hey, you wanna<br />
  watch some TV?&quot;<br />
  Ernie's stomach was beginning to feel very bad indeed.<br />
  Actually, watching TV was about the last thing he wanted to do, but<br />
  considering the looks everyone was giving him at the moment, he<br />
  thought perhaps he had just better keep his mouth shut.<br />
  The Fly and Mr. Ed returned from the other side of the room.<br />
  Mr. Ed seemed to have cheered up considerably. &quot;Hey, what's on TV?&quot;<br />
  the Fly asked Captain Memory.<br />
  &quot;Let me see,&quot; the Captain leafed through the pages. &quot;Wanna<br />
  watch a movie? How about `Beach Blanket Chainsaw Massacre'? `Irate<br />
  viewers get sick of aging beach stars and cut them up with power<br />
  tools', with Frankie Avalon, Annette Funicello, Lucille Ball, and<br />
  Desi Arnaz.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Maybe,&quot; said the Fly thoughtfully. &quot;What else is on?&quot;<br />
  &quot;You like horror movies?&quot; said the Captain. &quot;How about<br />
  `Goldfish from Hell'? `Suburban family discovers their pet is<br />
  possessed by evil spirits', with Flipper, Lucille Ball, and Desi<br />
  Arnaz.<br />
  &quot;Nah,&quot; said the Fly. &quot;I don't like horror movies.&quot;<br />
  &quot;How about `Gidget Goes Berserk'? `Gidget gets a chainsaw for<br />
  Christmas and...&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh no,&quot; Sterno broke in. &quot;I simply cannot tolerate Gidget<br />
  movies!&quot;<br />
  &quot;How about `Kung-Fu Tigers Go Hawaiian', with Bruce Lee,<br />
  Lucille Ball, and Desi Arnaz?&quot;<br />
  Ernie noticed something odd about the TV listings. &quot;Say,<br />
  doesn't it seem a little strange that Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz<br />
  are in all these different movies?&quot;<br />
  &quot;No, I don't think it's strange at all,&quot; drawled Mr. Ed. &quot;Do<br />
  you?&quot;<br />
  Sterno glared at Ernie. &quot;After all YOU'VE done, I should think<br />
  you'd be content to sit quietly and mind your own business!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Hey, you'll like this!&quot; Captain Memory said to the Fly.<br />
  &quot;Wanna watch the `Miss Galaxy Pageant'?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Sure thing!&quot; the Fly enthused. &quot;Turn it on!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Okay, I'll get up and turn it on. I'll have to get up<br />
  because,&quot; The Captain glared at Ernie. &quot;I don't have a remote!&quot;<br />
  Ernie shrank into his seat.<br />
  The Captain turned on the television. &quot;...and here's our<br />
  celebrity judges, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz!&quot; The camera panned<br />
  in to the two celebrities.<br />
  `That's odd,' thought Ernie. `They don't look the way I<br />
  remember them. I don't recall them having such pointy teeth. Oh<br />
  well, it's probably just the lighting, or something.'<br />
  &quot;Now, our first contestant...&quot; The girls began parading by.<br />
  Ernie noticed that the girls in this pageant didn't look quite like<br />
  the one's he was used to seeing. For one thing, they were all a lot<br />
  plumper than the beauty queens at home. None of them seemed to have<br />
  much personality, either. They all looked sort of bovine.<br />
  &quot;Isn't she a delicious young lady,&quot; the announcer was saying.<br />
  &quot;Look at those scrumptious legs, those mouth-watering shoulders,<br />
  those tender, juicy thighs!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Gee, these girls aren't very cute!&quot; said the Fly,<br />
  disappointed. &quot;Not like at home!&quot;<br />
  &quot;They look positively delicious to me!&quot; commented Mr. Ed.<br />
  Ernie looked at Mr. Ed suspiciously. That seemed to him to be<br />
  a very strange comment to be coming from a horse. But then, come to<br />
  think of it, any comment was strange coming from a horse. <br />
  &quot;You wanna watch something else?&quot; Captain Memory asked the<br />
  Fly.<br />
  &quot;No, no, that's okay,&quot; said the Fly quickly. &quot;I'm sure they'll<br />
  get better!&quot;<br />
  The pageant continued. &quot;...our next mouth-watering<br />
  contestant...&quot; The camera cut to the celebrity judges. They seemed<br />
  to be drooling slightly. A little forked tongue seemed to dart in<br />
  and out of their mouths. Or maybe it was just a trick of the light.<br />
  Ernie felt uneasy. Beauty pageants at home weren't like this. He<br />
  decided to try not to look at it. He regarded the horse instead.<br />
  There was definitely something peculiar about that horse,<br />
  Ernie decided. It seemed to be somewhat lumpy and misshapen. There<br />
  seemed to be a line going around its middle, almost like a seam.<br />
  Why would a horse have a seam?<br />
  &quot;...the new Miss Galaxy!&quot; The shouts and applause drew Ernie's<br />
  attention back to the television, where the winning contestant was<br />
  being crowned. &quot;And now..&quot; The celebrity judges leaned forward<br />
  expectantly. Their broad grins revealed rows of needle-sharp teeth.<br />
  Their forked tongues flicked in and out of their mouths in<br />
  anticipation. &quot;...it's CARVING TIME!&quot; The announcer whipped out a<br />
  whirring chainsaw and advanced on the hapless Miss Galaxy, who<br />
  struggled feebly while the two runner-ups held her in place.<br />
  &quot;Oh man!&quot; the Fly complained. &quot;I told you, I don't like horror<br />
  movies! They give me the creeps! Let's watch something else!&quot; He<br />
  changed the channel.<br />
  A commercial was on the new station. A man was sitting behind<br />
  a desk, looking deadpan directly at the camera. The phone on the<br />
  desk began to ring. &quot;Does your heart sink when the telephone<br />
  rings,&quot; the man said. &quot;Because of bill collectors constantly<br />
  threatening you about unpaid debts?&quot;<br />
  `Hmm,' Ernie thought. `As a matter of fact, it does.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Why not call Acme Debt Counseling Service?&quot; the commercial<br />
  continued. &quot;We've helped millions avoid the nightmare of bad debts.<br />
  We'll set up a payment plan you can afford, and get those bill<br />
  collectors off your back once and for all. Call today!&quot;<br />
  `That's an idea,' Ernie thought. `I don't know if it'll work,<br />
  but it's worth a try. Maybe they can keep Vito away long enough for<br />
  us to get out of here, at least!' He picked up the phone and dialed<br />
  the number that was displayed at the bottom of the screen.<br />
  &quot;Acme Debt Counseling Service,&quot; a woman's voice answered.<br />
  &quot;Yeah, I just...&quot; Ernie began.<br />
  &quot;Ah, Mr. Ross!&quot; A man's voice cut in. &quot;We've been expecting<br />
  you! I have your file right here in front of me!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh.&quot; Ernie was taken aback. How could they have known he was<br />
  going to call?<br />
  &quot;You'll be pleased to know that we've worked out a very<br />
  convenient payment plan to take care of this matter,&quot; the man<br />
  continued. &quot;The collection agency has agreed to accept the payment<br />
  plan, and has agreed to call off Vito, who was on his way<br />
  to...well, we'd rather not say what Vito was going to do. But<br />
  anyway, you don't need to worry about that now. Everything is all<br />
  taken care of!&quot; Ernie heaved a sigh of relief. This collection<br />
  agency business was really beginning to bother him. They seemed to<br />
  be able to find him, no matter where in time or space he was. He<br />
  was really glad that he wasn't going to have to worry about it any<br />
  more.<br />
  &quot;We've broken this down into small, easy-to-afford weekly<br />
  payments,&quot; the man on the phone continued. &quot;Now, if you'll just<br />
  send in the first week's payment - in cash, of course,&quot; the man<br />
  laughed. &quot;You can't expect us to accept a check from someone with<br />
  YOUR credit history - we'll get the ball rolling on this!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Um, how much is the payment?&quot; Ernie asked hesitantly.<br />
  &quot;Only $412,865,945.43 a week!&quot; the main exclaimed glowingly.<br />
  &quot;Hey, don't thank us, it's our job!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Uh..um..ahem,&quot; Ernie cleared his throat nervously.<br />
  The man on the phone stopped. There was an awkward silence.<br />
  &quot;You're NOT going to tell us you don't have $412,865,945.43, are<br />
  you?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Uh, well...&quot;Ernie began. &quot;Um, I don't exactly have that much<br />
  on me, right now, that is. If you could give me a little time...a<br />
  couple of years, maybe...?&quot;<br />
  The man on the phone sighed. &quot;Oh, that IS unfortunate! Well,<br />
  there may still be something we can do. I'll have to talk to my<br />
  supervisor about this. Please hold!&quot; The man's voice disappeared,<br />
  and tinny Muzak came over the receiver in it's place.<br />
  Ernie sighed. Well, he hadn't really thought that was going to<br />
  work anyway. Still, maybe they could come up with something yet. He<br />
  waited, listening to low-fidelity versions of 1950's pop hits<br />
  played by the Million and One Strings. Ernie sighed again. He hated<br />
  being left on hold.<br />
  After what seemed a very long time the man's voice reappeared.<br />
  &quot;Good news!&quot; he exclaimed cheerfully. &quot;My supervisor said we may<br />
  still be able to work something out!&quot;<br />
  Ernie breathed a sigh of relief. &quot;Great!&quot;<br />
  The man continued. &quot;My supervisor says that if you don't have<br />
  the cash right now, we might be able to accept something else of<br />
  value instead.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Like what?&quot; Ernie couldn't imagine what he might have with<br />
  him that would be worth $412,865,945.43.<br />
  &quot;Oh, I don't know. Just some little thing,&quot; the man said<br />
  evasively. &quot;Like, maybe...your brain.&quot;<br />
  &quot;MY BRAIN!&quot; Ernie shrieked.<br />
  &quot;Now, now, don't get excited,&quot; the man said soothingly. &quot;After<br />
  all, what's one little brain among friends? You'll never miss it!&quot;<br />
  &quot;FORGET IT!&quot; Ernie slammed down the phone.<br />
  Mr. Ed shook his head sadly. &quot;I think you should have taken<br />
  that deal,&quot; he advised.<br />
  &quot;Forget it! I'm not going to give them my brain!&quot; He glared at<br />
  the horse. &quot;What business is it of yours, anyway?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Hey!&quot; The Fly interceded. &quot;Don't pick on Mr. Ed!&quot; He stroked<br />
  the horse. &quot;Nice horsey!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Why not give them your brain?&quot; Sterno suggested. &quot;You never<br />
  use it!&quot;<br />
  Ernie glared. &quot;Leave me alone!&quot;<br />
  Ernie looked at the TV.  Black-and-white images of Lucille<br />
  Ball and Desi Arnaz were on the screen. Lucy seemed to be upset<br />
  about something. &quot;What are we watching, anyway? More `I Love Lucy'<br />
  reruns?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory looked at the TV Guide. &quot;That's funny. This is<br />
  supposed to be a movie called `Nazi Cheerleaders from Planet X'.&quot;<br />
  Ernie looked at the TV. &quot;Oh yeah? Who's in it?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory consulted the TV Guide. &quot;Let me see, uh...<br />
  Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz.&quot;<br />
  Ernie frowned. &quot;I dunno. It looks an awful lot like `I Love<br />
  Lucy' to me.&quot; Ernie thought a moment. &quot;Doesn't it strike you as<br />
  just a little bit odd that absolutely EVERYTHING on TV right now<br />
  has Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in it?&quot;<br />
  &quot;No, I don't think that's odd at all,&quot; said Mr. Ed in his<br />
  typical, low-voiced drawl. &quot;Why shouldn't Lucille Ball and Desi<br />
  Arnaz be in everything? They're probably the two greatest<br />
  performers who ever lived!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Huh?&quot; Ernie didn't know how to answer that.<br />
  &quot;In fact,&quot; Mr. Ed went on rapturously. &quot;I'd say that they are<br />
  definitely the finest performers that show business has ever<br />
  produced, the greatest that ever COULD be produced, in fact, in all<br />
  of time and space, no-one, anywhere in the universe, could possibly<br />
  even approach the greatness of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, come off it!&quot; snapped Sterno irritatedly. &quot;They're just<br />
  a couple of second-rate TV actors!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Ay, carramba!&quot; Mr. Ed cried furiously. &quot;What chu talkin'<br />
  about! Dey de greatest! Especialmente Desi Arnaz, de greatest Cuban<br />
  bandleader in de world!&quot;<br />
  Ernie looked at Mr. Ed suspiciously. &quot;Hey, what happened to<br />
  your voice? Where did you get that Cuban accent?&quot;<br />
  Mr. Ed was flustered. &quot;Hey man, I...uh...oh..&quot; Something very<br />
  peculiar seemed to be happening to Mr. Ed. He seemed to be writhing<br />
  in a very un-horselike manner.<br />
  Suddenly, Mr. Ed fell in half. Both halves lay on the floor,<br />
  each writhing independently. Ernie was stunned. He stared at the<br />
  two halves of Mr. Ed, jaws open with astonishment. Suddenly, a head<br />
  covered with rolled red curls popped out of the back half of Mr.<br />
  Ed. &quot;Oh, uh, hi guys!&quot; It was Lucy.<br />
  Lucy turned to the front half of Mr. Ed, which was still<br />
  writhing on the floor. &quot;Oh, Ricky! I told you to let me be the<br />
  front half of the horse! Now look what's happened!&quot;<br />
  A voice came from the front half of Mr. Ed. &quot;Lucy! I stuck in<br />
  dis horse suit! Help me out, okay?&quot; The front half of Mr. Ed<br />
  thrashed wildly, filling the room with the sound of thuds and<br />
  maracas.<br />
  Lucy struggled out of her half of the horse suit, and ran over<br />
  to help Ricky. However, the more she tried to help him, the more<br />
  tangled up he got.<br />
  The Fly looked ruefully at the horse suit. &quot;Poor Mr. Ed!&quot;<br />
  Ernie turned to Captain Memory. &quot;Now what?&quot;<br />
  The Captain was still reading his TV Guide. &quot;How about `She-<br />
  Devils of Green Gables', with Shirley Temple and...&quot; He was<br />
  interrupted by a loud pounding on the door. &quot;Open up!&quot;<br />
  They all looked up, startled. The pounding came again. &quot;Open<br />
  da door, punk! I know you're in dere!&quot;<br />
  Lucy turned to Ricky, who was still stuck in the horse suit.<br />
  &quot;Oh, Ricky! It's Vito! Let him in, will you? Maybe he can get our<br />
  brain from that awful Ernie person!&quot; She glared at Ernie.<br />
  Ricky struggled in the horse outfit. &quot;You got to get me out of<br />
  here!&quot; He cried, distressed. &quot;I can't see nuttin' in dis suit!&quot;<br />
  Ernie turned to Captain Memory. &quot;I think we ought to get out<br />
  of here, okay?&quot;<br />
  The Captain continued to peruse his TV Guide. &quot;Oh, you'll like<br />
  this one! `A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Attila the Hun'<br />
  with Zero Mostel and...&quot;<br />
  Ernie paced anxiously. &quot;Look, we've got to do something! All<br />
  these people are after my brain!&quot;<br />
  Sterno shrugged. &quot;Call the police!&quot;<br />
  Ernie started. The police! That was worth a try. He grabbed<br />
  the phone, and dialed `911'.<br />
  Ernie fidgeted impatiently while the phone rang. He heard the<br />
  sound of the phone being taken off the hook. &quot;You gotta help me...&quot;<br />
  he began.<br />
  He stopped. The voice on the other end was a recording: &quot;We're<br />
  sorry, all of our officers are busy at the moment. If you're being<br />
  murdered, please leave a clue, and one of our detectives will<br />
  contact your next-of-kin as soon as possible. Thank you, and have<br />
  a nice day!&quot; Ernie slammed the phone down disgustedly.<br />
  Vito pounded on the door again. &quot;Open up!&quot; Ernie looked<br />
  apprehensively at Ricky, who was still struggling to get out of the<br />
  horse suit. &quot;Look, I really think we ought to get out of here!<br />
  Like, NOW!&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory looked up in annoyance. &quot;Well, if you're going<br />
  to be that way about it...!&quot; He got up and strode across the living<br />
  room, and through an open doorway which seemed to lead into the<br />
  kitchen.<br />
  &quot;Hey, wait for me!&quot; cried Ernie, chasing after him. As he ran,<br />
  he grabbed the Psion Megaforce Generator. He wasn't about to leave<br />
  a fortune in precious Bakelite behind! He continued to follow the<br />
  Captain. He didn't know where Captain Memory was going, but he<br />
  figured it would have to be an improvement. <br />
  The Captain walked through the next room, which was the<br />
  typical suburban kitchen, opened a typical suburban back door, and<br />
  stepped outside. Ernie and the others followed quickly behind him.<br />
  They found themselves once again standing in a countryside of<br />
  green rolling hills. The village in the distance seemed to have<br />
  burned itself out, and only feeble wisps of smoke were rising from<br />
  it.<br />
  &quot;I'm awfully glad we got out of there,&quot; commented Sterno. &quot;It<br />
  was really getting dreadfully noisy! My ears are very sensitive,<br />
  you know.&quot;<br />
  The Fly was the last of the group to leave the villa. He shook<br />
  his head sadly. &quot;Poor Mr. Ed! It must have been a real shock to<br />
  him, falling in half like that!&quot;<br />
  Ernie considered trying to explain the situation to him, but<br />
  decided it wasn't worth the trouble. He turned to Captain Memory.<br />
  &quot;Now what?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory looked around. &quot;Nice day, isn't it?&quot;<br />
  Ernie tapped his feet impatiently. &quot;I think it would be a good<br />
  idea if we went someplace else! They're going to be coming after us<br />
  any minute now!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Not after US,&quot; Sterno corrected. &quot;After YOU.&quot;<br />
  Ernie frowned. &quot;Yeah. They want my brain. They don't want your<br />
  brain.&quot;<br />
  Sterno thought about this, and decided he was offended. &quot;Well!<br />
  That just shows what those silly aliens know! If they knew anything<br />
  about brains at all, they'd realize mine is clearly superior!&quot;<br />
  An idea occurred to Ernie. &quot;Yeah, you're right. Maybe I should<br />
  tell them?&quot;<br />
  Sterno frowned. &quot;You know, I think we should go someplace<br />
  else. It's suddenly become awfully boring around here!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Nice day for a walk, don't you think?&quot; said Captain Memory,<br />
  strolling off towards the yellow brick road. The others followed<br />
  quickly.</p>
<p> CHAPTER 7</p>
<p> After a few minutes walking, the four travelers through<br />
  Cyberspace began to see an encampment of some kind in the distance.<br />
  &quot;What do you suppose that is?&quot; Ernie wondered.<br />
  &quot;I dunno,&quot; commented Captain Memory. &quot;Want to turn around and<br />
  go the other way?&quot;<br />
  Ernie thought of Lucy, Ricky, and Vito, all of whom were<br />
  somewhere behind them. &quot;No, let's just keep going.&quot;<br />
  &quot;It doesn't really matter which way we go,&quot; commented Sterno.<br />
  &quot;After all, all roads lead to Rome.&quot;<br />
  Ernie thought about that. &quot;It seems to me that would cause a<br />
  lot of traffic problems,&quot; he said reflectively.<br />
  The Fly peered into the distance. &quot;Somebody's coming!&quot;<br />
  Ernie started. &quot;Uh oh, what do we do now?&quot; He thought a<br />
  moment. &quot;Are they Romans or Huns?&quot;<br />
  &quot;How should I know!&quot; The Fly answered.<br />
  &quot;Well, what are they wearing?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Funny outfits!&quot; The Fly shrugged. &quot;What are they supposed to<br />
  be wearing?&quot;<br />
  Ernie sighed. &quot;I dunno. I sort of hoped they'd be wearing<br />
  togas, or something.&quot; The men approaching were coming into Ernie's<br />
  range of vision. They seemed to be a military patrol. They wore<br />
  armor, some kind of leggings, and carried shields, bows and spears.<br />
  &quot;So, what are they?&quot; the Fly wanted to know. &quot;Romans or Huns?&quot;<br />
  &quot;I dunno,&quot; Ernie said. &quot;Might as well flip a coin, I guess.&quot;<br />
  &quot;You got a coin?&quot;<br />
  &quot;I left all my money in my other pants pocket,&quot; Ernie<br />
  admitted. <br />
  &quot;So, just pick one, then,&quot; the Fly urged.<br />
  &quot;Well, Romans then. If they're Romans, we could talk to them<br />
  in Latin. I don't know what we could do if they're Huns. What<br />
  language do they speak, Hungarian? I don't speak Hungarian.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Do you speak Latin?&quot; asked Sterno sarcastically.<br />
  &quot;Well...well...I used to watch a lot of gladiator movies,&quot;<br />
  said Ernie hopefully.<br />
  &quot;Good enough!&quot; said the Fly encouragingly. &quot;You go talk to<br />
  them, then!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Why ME?!&quot;<br />
  &quot;It was your idea!&quot; the Fly returned.<br />
  &quot;It was NOT my idea! I never...&quot;<br />
  &quot;We'll just go hide in these bushes in the meantime!&quot; The Fly<br />
  sprinted off towards a little group of bushes on the other side of<br />
  the hill, followed by Sterno and Captain Memory.<br />
  Ernie saw that the soldiers had noticed him. They were<br />
  pointing in his direction and saying something that Ernie could not<br />
  make out. Ernie decided his only course of action was to brazen it<br />
  out. He bit his lip uncertainly, and walked forward in what he<br />
  hoped would seem like a confident manner. He tried to think of<br />
  something to say in Latin. &quot;Uh, `E Pluribus Unum'!'&quot; he called out.<br />
  &quot;`Gallia est divisio in partes tres!'&quot;<br />
  They soldiers looked at him. &quot;Hey, get a load a this!&quot; the<br />
  first soldier said. &quot;It's a Roman in a funny outfit!&quot; He turned to<br />
  the soldier next to him. &quot;Hey Frank, gimme an arrow, will ya? I<br />
  wanna shoot this guy!&quot;<br />
  Ernie realized that he had made a serious tactical error. He<br />
  decided that the correct move at this point would be to beat a<br />
  hasty retreat. Turning abruptly, he sprinted towards the other side<br />
  of the hill, half-expecting to feel an arrow in his back at any<br />
  moment. As he ran, he could hear little bits of the soldier's<br />
  conversation drifting in his direction: &quot;...whaddya mean, you don't<br />
  got any arrows! I told you to save some arrows! How come nobody<br />
  never does what I tell 'em?&quot;<br />
  Ernie ran for the bunch of bushes the others were hiding in.<br />
  &quot;What happened?&quot; the Fly asked eagerly.<br />
  &quot;We guessed wrong,&quot; answered Ernie glumly.<br />
  &quot;Well, we better do something,&quot; said the Fly. &quot;'Cause they're<br />
  coming this way!&quot;<br />
  &quot;I don't think they can find us in here!&quot; said Ernie<br />
  hopefully.<br />
  &quot;Oh, yes, they can,&quot; returned Sterno. &quot;There's a trail of<br />
  sequins leading right to us!&quot;<br />
  Ernie's heart sank. He knew he'd never hear the end of this.<br />
  &quot;Oh man,&quot; said the Fly. &quot;You better ditch that suit! It's<br />
  getting us in a lot of trouble!&quot;<br />
  Luckily, Ernie still had his fur loincloth, sandals, and<br />
  plastic broadsword. He had been afraid to discard them, since,<br />
  after all, he had put a forty-dollar deposit on them. He quickly<br />
  changed into the Goombah the Barbarian costume, and hid the<br />
  toreador outfit under a rock.<br />
  No sooner had he finished changing then they heard a voice<br />
  coming from behind them. &quot;Hey, what are you guys doing in those<br />
  bushes?&quot;<br />
  The same group of soldiers Ernie had encountered on the road<br />
  was there behind them. Ernie thought fast. &quot;Uh, we're looking for<br />
  blueberries! You guys see any blueberries around here?&quot;<br />
  &quot;No,&quot; answered the first soldier. &quot;And anyway, it ain't<br />
  blueberry season, so why don't you guys come out of there, real<br />
  slow?&quot; The soldiers held their spears in a menacing fashion.<br />
  &quot;Sure, whatever you say,&quot; Ernie laughed nervously.<br />
  The soldiers inspected the foursome suspiciously. The first<br />
  soldier looked at Ernie. &quot;So, what are you supposed to be?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Uh, I'm Goombah the Barbarian!&quot; Ernie announced.<br />
  The first soldier guffawed. &quot;Hey Frank, get a load a this!<br />
  This guy thinks he's a barbarian!&quot; The other soldiers laughed<br />
  uproariously.<br />
  Ernie sulked. He didn't see what was so funny about it.<br />
  &quot;What did he say his name was?&quot; asked Frank. &quot;Gumby? Gumby the<br />
  Barbarian?&quot; The soldiers all laughed hysterically. &quot;Lookit this -<br />
  he's got a plastic broadsword! A real tough guy!&quot; He doubled over<br />
  with laughter.<br />
  The first soldier gradually composed himself. &quot;Say,&quot; he said,<br />
  wiping tears of laughter from his eyes. &quot;You didn't see a Roman in<br />
  a funny suit go by here, did you? He left a trail of sequins that<br />
  led right in here!&quot;<br />
  Ernie thought fast, again. &quot;Uh, as a matter of fact, yeah. He<br />
  went thataway.&quot; Ernie pointed down the road.<br />
  The soldiers looked in that direction. &quot;Aw, we might as well<br />
  forget it. We'll never get him now!&quot; The second soldier looked at<br />
  Ernie. &quot;So, what are we gonna do with Gumby here?&quot; At the mention<br />
  of the name `Gumby', the soldiers all started laughing hysterically<br />
  again. <br />
  &quot;`Gumby the Barbarian', huh?&quot; the first soldier commented,<br />
  after he had stopped laughing to the point that he could speak<br />
  again. &quot;Well, I'm Joe the Hun,&quot; he said, introducing himself. &quot;This<br />
  here's Frank the Hun, and back there, that's Pete the Hun.&quot; He<br />
  looked at the foursome. &quot;What a weird bunch! I guess we'd better<br />
  take all you guys to the boss!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Who's the boss?&quot; asked Ernie. <br />
  &quot;Attila the Hun!&quot; answered Joe.<br />
  `That figures', Ernie thought. Ernie decided that maybe he<br />
  would go along and meet Attila the Hun, especially since he<br />
  couldn't see any alternative at the moment. The foursome headed off<br />
  down the road in the direction of the burning village, escorted by<br />
  the Hun soldiers.<br />
  After a few minutes walk they entered the encampment of the<br />
  Huns. The soldiers led them to a large tent, where they were<br />
  ushered into the presence of an imposing figure. A large, heavily<br />
  muscled man in armor sat or a golden throne, leaning on a huge<br />
  broadsword. &quot;Attila, King of the Huns!&quot; a soldier announced.<br />
  Attila regarded the foursome carefully. &quot;Why have you brought<br />
  these creatures before me?&quot; he demanded in a thunderous voice.<br />
  &quot;Uh, well sir,&quot; said Joe the Hun timidly. &quot;We didn't know what<br />
  else to do with them.&quot; He started to giggle. &quot;This one,&quot; he pointed<br />
  at Ernie. &quot;He says his name's Gumby the Barbarian!&quot; He put his hand<br />
  over his mouth to stifle his laughter.<br />
  Attila regarded Ernie seriously. &quot;Is that correct?&quot; he<br />
  demanded sternly.<br />
  &quot;Uh, actually it's `Goombah'&quot; Ernie said timorously.<br />
  Attila erupted in thunderous laughter. &quot;That's great! `Gumby<br />
  the Barbarian!' That's hysterical!&quot; He turned to the soldiers. &quot;You<br />
  guys dressed him up like this for a joke, right?&quot;<br />
  &quot;No, it's for real!&quot; Joe protested. &quot;We just found 'em like<br />
  this!&quot; <br />
  Attila doubled over with laughter. Wiping the tears from his<br />
  eyes, he turned to the Fly. &quot;Hey, lookit this guy's mask! It's<br />
  really weird!&quot; <br />
  &quot;That's not a mask!&quot; the Fly was offended. &quot;That's my face!&quot;<br />
  Attila erupted into hysterical laughter again. &quot;He says it's<br />
  his face! That cracks me up!&quot; The laughter was contagious; all the<br />
  soldiers were doubled up with laughter, too.<br />
  &quot;Hey, Gumby!&quot; Attila chortled. &quot;What are you gonna do with<br />
  that plastic broadsword? You gonna loot, pillage and rape?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well, uh,&quot; Ernie stammered. &quot;I'm, uh, not exactly sure how to<br />
  do that. Besides, uh, don't you need a license for that, or<br />
  something?&quot;<br />
  Attila broke up again. &quot;`License to loot'! I love it! These<br />
  guys are hysterical!&quot;<br />
  Sterno was getting annoyed. &quot;This IS getting a bit tedious!&quot;<br />
  he complained.<br />
  Attila's jaw dropped. &quot;Wow! A talking dog! What a great act!<br />
  I get it now, you guys are traveling clowns, right? You're part of<br />
  a circus, right?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory looked perturbed. He seemed to be sensitive<br />
  about being called a clown. &quot;Is that an insult?&quot;<br />
  Attila collapsed in laughter again. &quot;`Is that an insult?', he<br />
  says, and he says it with a straight face! You guys really crack me<br />
  up!&quot;<br />
  The foursome shifted about uncomfortably while Attila buried<br />
  his face in his arms, laughing uncontrollably. After what seemed to<br />
  be a very long time, Attila looked up, tears of laughter still<br />
  streaming down his face. &quot;Say, you guys are just great! We've been<br />
  doing so much raping, looting, and pillaging that it's just not<br />
  that much fun anymore! What I really need these days is a good<br />
  laugh! I feel a lot better now!&quot; He thought a moment. &quot;I think I'll<br />
  give you guys a reward!&quot; He turned to Ernie. &quot;How about a bag of<br />
  gold? Would you like that?&quot; <br />
  Ernie considered that. &quot;Yeah, I guess that would be nice. I<br />
  owe kind of a lot of money right now, and I've been having a lot of<br />
  problem with bill collectors.&quot;<br />
  Attila chuckled. &quot;Yeah, I had a lot of trouble with bill<br />
  collectors, too. But I solved that problem. Wanna know how?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Yeah!&quot; Ernie was excited. Maybe he could use this solution<br />
  for his bill-paying problems.<br />
  Attila chuckled. &quot;I chopped their heads off! You should have<br />
  seen their faces!&quot; He thought a moment. &quot;In fact, I think I still<br />
  have them around here somewhere. Wanna see 'em?&quot;<br />
  Ernie grimaced. &quot;No that's okay. I'm not supposed to look at<br />
  severed heads. It makes my stomach hurt.&quot;<br />
  At this, Attila collapsed into helpless laughter again. &quot;You<br />
  guys are just a laugh a minute! Just when I think I've heard it<br />
  all, you come up with another one!&quot; <br />
  Ernie frowned. None of this seemed very funny to him at all.<br />
  &quot;You Huns really have a strange sense of humor.&quot;<br />
  Attila's brow furled. &quot;We do, huh?&quot; he said menacingly.<br />
  Sterno and the Fly turned to look at Ernie. Ernie shuffled<br />
  uncomfortably. It occurred to him that maybe he shouldn't have said<br />
  that. <br />
  A broad grin appeared across Attila's face. &quot;That's funny! I<br />
  like it!&quot; Ernie heaved a sigh of relief.<br />
  Suddenly, a messenger ran up to the King of the Huns. &quot;Your<br />
  magnificence, we found these strangers lurking around the edge of<br />
  the camp!&quot; <br />
  Ernie looked behind him. Hun soldiers were dragging forth<br />
  three struggling captives. The first was someone Ernie did not<br />
  recognize -  a beefy man in an ill-fitting suit. The other two were<br />
  Lucy and Desi. &quot;Oh, Vito!&quot; Lucy said to the beefy man. &quot;Make them<br />
  let us go!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh my gosh!&quot; said Ernie involuntarily.<br />
  Attila looked at Ernie sternly. &quot;Do you know these people?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Uh, sort of,&quot; Ernie admitted. &quot;They're, uh, bill collectors!&quot;<br />
  Attila's face lit up. &quot;Bill collectors! My favorite! Oh, what<br />
  fun! Let's see,&quot; he paused reflectively. &quot;Shall we boil them in<br />
  oil, or flay them alive? Maybe we could boil them until they're<br />
  tender, and then flay them? Or maybe...&quot; He strode off to examine<br />
  his new captives, leaving Ernie and the other alone. <br />
  &quot;Looks like you've solved the bill collector problem,&quot; Sterno<br />
  said to Ernie.<br />
  &quot;Uh, yeah, I guess so,&quot; decided Ernie. &quot;So, why don't we get<br />
  out of here before Attila decides to do something like that to us,<br />
  too?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, he wouldn't do that,&quot; the Fly said. &quot;Attila likes us!&quot;<br />
  Ernie watched as Attila fingered Lucy's red curls. Lucy bit<br />
  him. Attila drew his sword.<br />
  Ernie decided he didn't want to watch what came next. &quot;Just<br />
  the same, let's go, okay?&quot;<br />
  &quot;What's the matter?&quot; said Sterno tauntingly. &quot;Don't you want<br />
  to see what Attila's going to do to them?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Uh, I'd just as soon not, all right? Let's just go, okay?<br />
  Sterno continued to look back. &quot;Looks like Lucy's losing her<br />
  head over Attila,&quot; he said, smirking. Ernie's stomach turned over<br />
  again. He hadn't really felt very good ever since eating that<br />
  remote control unit; he was sure he didn't want to see anything<br />
  that might make him feel worse. <br />
  Attila strode back to his throne, his huge broadsword<br />
  dripping bright red blood. &quot;Gee, that was fun!&quot; He sighed. &quot;Well,<br />
  I guess I gotta get back to business. Who am I supposed to see<br />
  next?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Three representatives of the King of the Parthians, your<br />
  majesty,&quot; an attendant told him.<br />
  &quot;Oh yeah? What are their names?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Larry, Moe, and Curly,&quot; the attendant answered.<br />
  Attila thought a moment. &quot;Are they funny?&quot;<br />
  &quot;I believe so, sire.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well then, let's see 'em!&quot; With that, the foursome found<br />
  themselves ushered out of the tent.<br />
  The four of them stood outside Attila's tent. &quot;Well, now<br />
  what?&quot; The Fly wanted to know.<br />
  &quot;That's a good question,&quot; Captain Memory began. &quot;Yes sir,<br />
  that...&quot;<br />
  &quot;Okay, okay,&quot; Ernie cut him off. He didn't want to hear that<br />
  whole thing all over again. &quot;Let's just get out of here, okay?<br />
  Everybody keeps pointing at us and laughing!&quot; Sure enough, as they<br />
  looked around, they noticed the passing Huns all pointing the<br />
  foursome out to each other and making what Ernie was sure were<br />
  snide comments. Ernie in particular was getting very sensitive<br />
  about snide comments made at his expense. &quot;Let's go, guys, okay?&quot;<br />
  he urged.<br />
  They began walking down the yellow brick road, heading out of<br />
  the Hun's camp. <br />
  Soon they were out of the camp, and heading once again across<br />
  the green hills. The road rolled on before them, over hill and<br />
  dale, heading towards Rome - maybe.<br />
  The road seemed to stretch on endlessly in front of them.<br />
  Ernie sighed. It looked like it was going to be a long walk.<br />
  After what seemed to be a very long time they noticed<br />
  something up ahead of them. It seemed to be a huge cloud of dust<br />
  heading across the countryside. Whatever it was, it was going to<br />
  cross the road a short distance in front of them.<br />
  Ernie strained his eyes. &quot;Can you make out what that is?&quot; he<br />
  said to the Fly.<br />
  &quot;Oh wow,&quot; said the Fly. &quot;It's a cattle drive!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Don't be ridiculous!&quot; snapped Sterno. &quot;Cattle can't drive!&quot;<br />
  &quot;No, no,&quot; the Fly protested. &quot;It's cows! A whole bunch of<br />
  cows!&quot;<br />
  &quot;`Herd' of cows,&quot; Ernie corrected.<br />
  &quot;Of course I've heard of cows!&quot; snapped Sterno. &quot;Don't be<br />
  insulting!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well, they're coming this way,&quot; the Fly said.<br />
  As the four walked along, they began to make out more clearly<br />
  a vast number of cattle, raising a huge cloud of dust with their<br />
  hooves. &quot;What are all these cattle doing here?&quot; Ernie wondered.<br />
  As if in answer to that question, a lone figure on a horse<br />
  came galloping toward them.<br />
  &quot;Hey, it's a cowboy!&quot; the Fly said cheerfully. &quot;Hiya, cowboy!&quot;<br />
  He waved.<br />
  The cowboy galloped up to them and stopped. &quot;Howdy! Any of you<br />
  boys know the way to Abilene?&quot;<br />
  Ernie looked around. &quot;Uh, sorry. I'm a stranger here myself.&quot;<br />
  The cowboy scratched his head. &quot;This country don't look at all<br />
  familiar! We ain't seen a thing we recognize fer quite a spell,<br />
  now. Y'all know where this here road leads?&quot;<br />
  Ernie thought a moment. &quot;Uh, I think it leads to Rome, but I'm<br />
  not sure.&quot;<br />
  The cowboy considered that. &quot;Rome? Is that in Kansas?&quot;<br />
  &quot;I don't think so,&quot; Ernie said. <br />
  The cowboy stroked his horse's muzzle. &quot;Well, Toto,&quot; he said<br />
  to his horse. &quot;I don't think we're in Kansas anymore!&quot; He turned<br />
  back to Ernie. &quot;Well, thank ya'll kindly!&quot; he said, tipping his<br />
  hat. He galloped back to rejoin the herd.<br />
  Ernie turned to Captain Memory. &quot;What do you make of that?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Tsk, tsk,&quot; the Captain shook his head. &quot;The file corruption<br />
  is getting really severe. More and more data is turning up in the<br />
  wrong sector. I really don't know if the system is going to be able<br />
  to stand much more of this!&quot;<br />
  Ernie found this comment disturbing. &quot;Why? What'll happen<br />
  then?&quot;<br />
  The Captain shook his head sadly. &quot;Well...well, it might...&quot;<br />
  He trailed off.<br />
  Ernie hated it when people trailed off. It always made him<br />
  terribly uneasy. &quot;It might...what?&quot; he prompted.<br />
  Captain Memory looked uncomfortable. &quot;Are you sure you want to<br />
  know?&quot;<br />
  Ernie thought about this for a moment, and decided the Captain<br />
  was right: he didn't want to know. <br />
  The Fly, however, had become interested in the subject. &quot;Oh,<br />
  I get it, we're supposed to guess, right?&quot; he said brightly. &quot;First<br />
  syllable? Sounds like?&quot; He began gesticulating in a peculiar way,<br />
  as though trying to act out some unknown word. &quot;This is fun!&quot;<br />
  Sterno grimaced. &quot;Will you please stop making those disgusting<br />
  motions? I can't even begin to tell you how utterly offensive they<br />
  look!&quot;<br />
  The Fly paid no attention. &quot;I know, I know, it's a movie star,<br />
  right?&quot; He began prancing about in a very disconcerting manner. &quot;Is<br />
  it a dancer, huh? A dancer?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well, no...&quot; Captain Memory looked very uncomfortable.<br />
  &quot;I know! I know!&quot; The Fly jumped up and down excitedly. &quot;It's<br />
  Fred Astaire, right? Fred Astaire?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Uh, no...&quot; Captain Memory shifted about awkwardly.<br />
  &quot;Gene Kelly!&quot; The Fly shouted excitedly. &quot;It's Gene Kelly,<br />
  right?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Uh-uh.&quot; The Captain looked at the ground.<br />
  &quot;For heaven sake's, tell him already!&quot; snapped Sterno.<br />
  &quot;Nothing else is going to shut him up!&quot;<br />
  Ernie winced. He really didn't want to hear this. If it was<br />
  bad enough for Captain Memory to warn him about, it must be really<br />
  terrible. Especially considering all the terrible things the<br />
  Captain had told him WITHOUT warning him. He shuddered. No, he<br />
  definitely didn't want to hear this.<br />
  Captain Memory looked very unhappy. &quot;It's...uh...&quot;<br />
  &quot;I know! I know!&quot; The Fly was totally involved with the game.<br />
  &quot;Carmen Miranda! It's Carmen Miranda, right?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory sighed. &quot;It's...well, it's...TOTAL SYSTEM<br />
  FAILURE!&quot;<br />
  The Fly was totally taken aback. &quot;Huh? Sister Failure? Who's<br />
  she?&quot; He sulked. &quot;It's not fair to use people who aren't famous!<br />
  How am I supposed to guess that? What movies has she been in,<br />
  anyway?&quot;<br />
  Ernie sighed with relief. System Failure. Well, that wasn't<br />
  that bad! He frowned. It suddenly occurred to him that he might<br />
  feel differently if he had any idea what a `system failure' was.<br />
  &quot;What...&quot; he started to say, then stopped. On second thought,<br />
  perhaps he'd rather not know.<br />
  &quot;What in the world is a `total system failure' supposed to<br />
  be?&quot; Sterno demanded irritatedly.<br />
  Captain Memory sighed. &quot;That's when you totally exceed the<br />
  operating parameters of the system, to the point where not even the<br />
  multiple-redundant neural-net backups can compensate for it any<br />
  more.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Huh?&quot; Ernie wasn't following that.<br />
  &quot;Well,&quot; Captain Memory simplified. &quot;It's sort of like the<br />
  system has a heart attack.&quot;<br />
  Ernie thought about that. &quot;And, if the system has a heart<br />
  attack...&quot;<br />
  &quot;Then WE have a heart attack,&quot; Sterno finished for him.<br />
  Ernie moaned quietly. He'd had a feeling it was going to be<br />
  something like this. Why did they have to tell him this, anyway?<br />
  What was he, Ernie, supposed to do about it? What did they have to<br />
  tell him if there wasn't anything he could do about it? His stomach<br />
  hurt. He decided to try to think about something else.<br />
  Their path was now blocked by the herd, forcing the foursome<br />
  to cool their heels and wait for the animals to pass. They waited<br />
  while thousands of cattle went by, raising a huge cloud of choking<br />
  dust. Finally, the herd passed and the four continued on their way.<br />
  They walked for what once again seemed a very long time,<br />
  finding nothing. Finally, the Fly noticed something. &quot;Seems to be<br />
  something going on up ahead,&quot; he commented. &quot;Looks like a chariot<br />
  pulled over by the side of the road.&quot;<br />
  As the foursome approached, they could see that it indeed was<br />
  a chariot. Four Romans in togas stood around it. A tire on one of<br />
  the wheels seemed to have gone flat, and they were pumping it up<br />
  with a hand pump. Ernie frowned. &quot;Are chariots supposed to have<br />
  tires?&quot; <br />
  The Fly looked at the chariot. &quot;Hey, it's got old-fashioned<br />
  skinny tires on spoked wheels, like a Model T Ford. What do you<br />
  expect?&quot;<br />
  &quot;I dunno.&quot; Ernie was trying hard to remember what the<br />
  chariots looked like in the gladiator movies, however he hadn't<br />
  been paying attention that closely. &quot;With all the stuff that's been<br />
  happening, you can't be too careful!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Don't be such a worry wart!&quot; snapped Sterno. &quot;Suppose it IS<br />
  a phony chariot, what difference does it make?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Uh...&quot; Ernie hadn't thought that far ahead. His thoughts were<br />
  interrupted by one of the Romans who approached them. He was a<br />
  tall, thin man, wearing a toga. He seemed like a typical Roman out<br />
  of a gladiator movie, except for the fact that he wore a monocle<br />
  and jackboots.<br />
  The man's arm swept out in a Roman salute. &quot;Heil...I mean,<br />
  Hail!&quot; he said cheerfully. Ernie frowned. Weren't Romans supposed<br />
  to wear sandals?<br />
  The man continued. &quot;Ve chust finished fixing our chariot.<br />
  Perhaps you vould like a ride, ja?&quot;<br />
  &quot;You bet!&quot; said the Fly enthusiastically. &quot;Boy, I'm really<br />
  sick of walking!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well, I dunno...&quot; said Ernie. Something about this just<br />
  didn't seem right to him. He looked at the two white horses that<br />
  the chariot was hitched to, carefully examining them for any sign<br />
  of seams or lumpiness. No, they looked okay. Perfectly formed, with<br />
  no seams. One thing did seem odd about them, though: they didn't<br />
  move at all. They stood absolutely still, like statues. But then,<br />
  on the other hand, Ernie didn't really know that much about horses.<br />
  Maybe they were supposed to stand like that. It probably didn't<br />
  mean anything.<br />
  &quot;Oh, come ON!&quot; said Sterno impatiently. &quot;Quit making such an<br />
  issue about everything! Let's just get in, all right? I've had it<br />
  with walking!&quot;<br />
  &quot;I bet you must be dog tired, right?&quot; said the Fly.<br />
  &quot;Spare me your attempts at humor, you insectile moron!&quot; Sterno<br />
  barked.<br />
  The Fly looked upset. &quot;What did he mean by that?&quot; he said to<br />
  Ernie.<br />
  &quot;Time to go!&quot; urged the Roman. &quot;All aboard, ja?&quot;<br />
  Sterno and the Fly quickly scrambled aboard the chariot, which<br />
  seemed unusually large and spacious to Ernie. He got on as well, in<br />
  spite of his misgivings. Captain Memory brought up the rear. The<br />
  other three Romans then got on behind them, blocking the entrance<br />
  and making any escape impossible. Ernie felt very uneasy about<br />
  that. He was, however, relieved to see that Captain Memory did not<br />
  seem the least bit bothered by the situation. But then, Captain<br />
  Memory didn't seem the least bit bothered by ANY situation.<br />
  &quot;Vell, avay we go!&quot; said the Roman cheerfully. &quot;Giddap!&quot; He<br />
  snapped the reins.<br />
  Nothing happened. The horses stood there, totally immobile.<br />
  The Roman laughed nervously. &quot;Giddy UP!&quot; He lashed the horses with<br />
  the reins. Still nothing. From somewhere in his toga he produced a<br />
  riding crop, and began lashing the horses unmercifully. &quot;You vill<br />
  MOVE, you shtupid animals!&quot; The horses stood absolutely still,<br />
  totally unresponsive.<br />
  The Roman turned to the foursome with a nervous laugh. &quot;A<br />
  liddle problem, nothing to vorry about! No need to get out!&quot; He<br />
  jumped over the side of the chariot, and approached the horses<br />
  menacingly.<br />
  &quot;Uh, Herr Sturmbannfuhrer,&quot; one of the other Romans spoke up.<br />
  &quot;There is something ve forgot to tell you...&quot;<br />
  The first Roman gave the closest horse a swift kick in the<br />
  hind leg. The leg broke neatly off. The Roman jumped frantically<br />
  out of the way as the horse toppled slowly over and crashed to the<br />
  pavement, shattering into a million pieces.<br />
  The first Roman turned on the other Romans in a fury.<br />
  &quot;Idiots!&quot; he shrieked. &quot;You brought ze plaster horses! I told you,<br />
  ve must have ze REAL horses!&quot;<br />
  &quot;But, but Herr Sturmbannfuhrer,&quot; the second Roman sputtered.<br />
  &quot;Ze real horses, zey make doo-doo on ze floor!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Dummkopf!&quot; shrieked the first Roman. &quot;How can ve travel vith<br />
  plaster horses?&quot;<br />
  The other three Roman looked at each other in dismay. &quot;Oh. Ve<br />
  didn't tink of dat.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Idiots!&quot; The first Roman lashed the others with his riding<br />
  crop.<br />
  &quot;Oh man!&quot; said the Fly sadly. &quot;Does this mean we're gonna have<br />
  to walk after all?&quot;<br />
  The first Roman stopped abruptly, and turned to the foursome<br />
  with a bright smile. &quot;Oh no, of course not! Dis is chust a minor<br />
  problem, ve fix in chust a moment!&quot; The Roman pulled some sort of<br />
  small electronic device out of his toga, and scanned the<br />
  surrounding area with it. It beeped. &quot;Ah! Ze solution to our<br />
  problem is coming right down ze road!&quot;<br />
  An object appeared over the horizon, moving quickly down the<br />
  road in their direction. As it approached, Ernie could see that it<br />
  was a large chariot, pulled by four beautiful white horses. It<br />
  looked somehow familiar.<br />
  The four Romans stood in the middle of the road, blocking the<br />
  path as the chariot aproached. The man in the chariot stopped,<br />
  confused.<br />
  &quot;You!&quot; the first Roman shouted. &quot;Out of ze chariot! NOW!&quot; He<br />
  pulled an evil-looking weapon out of his toga, and pointed it at<br />
  the man in the chariot menacingly.<br />
  &quot;Make way! Make way!&quot; the man in the chariot cried out. &quot;I <br />
  have no time to waste! I'm on my way to the chariot races in Rome!&quot;<br />
  The man in the chariot looked very familiar to Ernie. Could it<br />
  be...Charlton Heston?<br />
  &quot;I have no time to vaste, either!&quot; The first Roman fired his<br />
  weapon at the man in the chariot, who vanished in a flash of flame.<br />
  &quot;Now,&quot; he turned to Ernie and the others. &quot;Ve vill take ZIS<br />
  chariot, ja?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh man!&quot; said the Fly mournfully. &quot;They're ruining all my<br />
  favorite shows! First Mr. Ed falls apart, and now they disintegrate<br />
  Ben-Hur!&quot;<br />
  Even Sterno was now beginning to get suspicious. &quot;Say,&quot; he<br />
  said to the first Roman. &quot;What's your name, anyway?&quot;<br />
  &quot;My name?&quot; the first Roman seemed nonplussed. &quot;You vant to<br />
  know my name?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Yeah!&quot; Ernie picked the question up. &quot;What's your name?&quot;<br />
  The first Roman laughed nervously. He elbowed the second Roman<br />
  sharply. &quot;Quick!&quot; he whispered. &quot;Vot's my name?!&quot; The second Roman<br />
  whispered something to him. The first Roman smiled agreeably. &quot;Oh<br />
  yes, my name! I am Marcus Provolonicus.&quot;<br />
  Sterno froze in horror. &quot;Provolone...It's CHEESE! Oh my god,<br />
  it's CHEESE! Run!&quot;<br />
  The other three Romans suddenly whipped out evil-looking<br />
  weapons. &quot;DO NOT MOVE!&quot; shrieked the first Roman. &quot;Or you vill<br />
  suffer ze same fate as our friend here!&quot; He gestured towards the<br />
  other chariot, which now contained only a little pile of ashes.<br />
  The first Roman tore off his toga, revealing a Nazi SS uniform<br />
  underneath. &quot;So, our liddle subterfuge does not fool you, eh?&quot; he<br />
  said menacingly. &quot;Dat is most...unfortunate. For vhich...&quot; He<br />
  looked around quickly. His eyes came to rest on the second Roman.<br />
  &quot;...YOU vill pay, dummkopf!&quot; He lashed the man with his riding<br />
  crop.<br />
  &quot;But, Herr Sturmbannfuhrer...&quot; the man began.<br />
  &quot;SILENCE!&quot; shrieked von Liederkranz. &quot;It is impossible to get<br />
  good help zese days!&quot; he sulked. &quot;Ze quality of ze Cyberslaves is<br />
  not vhat it used to be!&quot;<br />
  He turned to Ernie and the others. &quot;Now, you vill get on zis<br />
  chariot, and ve vill be on our vay!&quot; Ernie looked at von<br />
  Liederkranz's evil-looking weapons, and decided to do it the Nazi's<br />
  way. They boarded the other chariot. This time, the horses worked,<br />
  and they moved off quickly down the road.<br />
  &quot;Hey, this sure beats walking!&quot; said the Fly cheerfully, as<br />
  they thundered along the yellow brick road.<br />
  &quot;I dunno,&quot; said Ernie ruefully. &quot;Considering where we're<br />
  going, maybe we'd rather walk.&quot; Ernie frowned. &quot;Say,&quot; he said to<br />
  von Liederkranz. &quot;Where ARE we going, anyway?&quot;<br />
  Von Liederkranz smiled evilly. &quot;You'll find out soon enough!&quot;<br />
  Ernie looked on ahead. They appeared to be approaching<br />
  something. &quot;Oh, it's a town!&quot; said the Fly.<br />
  &quot;Vot!&quot; von Liederkranz snapped. &quot;Dere's not supposed to be a<br />
  town here! Whoa!&quot; He stopped the chariot. &quot;Vhere's my map?&quot; He<br />
  pulled out a map and began regarding it carefully. &quot;Ah, here's de<br />
  problem! Ve get on ze autobahn, und turn left at Heidelberg...&quot;<br />
  The other Romans had removed their togas as well, and stood<br />
  revealed as Nazi SS troopers. One of them peered over von<br />
  Liederkranz's shoulder. &quot;Uh, Herr Sturmbannfuhrer,&quot; he began<br />
  tentatively. &quot;Dat's a map of Bavaria!&quot;<br />
  Von Liederkranz started. He looked at the legend of the map,<br />
  and then crumpled it up angrily and threw it on the ground. &quot;I know<br />
  dat!&quot; he snapped. &quot;I vas chust...testing you. Very good!&quot; He<br />
  prodded the SS trooper with his riding crop. &quot;Okay, Mr. Know-it-<br />
  all, vhere do ve go now?&quot;<br />
  The trooper regarded the road carefully. &quot;Vell, since dere's<br />
  only one road, and dis isn't de right vay, I vould say ve go...de<br />
  other way!&quot;<br />
  Von Liederkranz thought a minute. &quot;Uh...right! De other vay!<br />
  Ve go de other vay!&quot; He wheeled the chariot around and they<br />
  galloped off in the other direction.<br />
  They charged on down the yellow brick road in the direction<br />
  from which they had come in the first place, moving faster this<br />
  time as von Liederkranz whipped the horses bad-temperedly. After<br />
  some time, they began to approach what seemed to be a town.<br />
  &quot;Oh wow,&quot; said the Fly. &quot;It's the same town! How did we get to<br />
  the same place when we went the opposite direction?&quot;<br />
  &quot;I told you so,&quot; smirked Sterno. &quot;`All Roads Lead to Rome'.<br />
  You're just going to have to go there. There's just no getting out<br />
  of it.&quot;<br />
  Von Liederkranz peered ahead. &quot;Gottverdammter! Vhere's my<br />
  map?&quot; He pulled out another map and regarded it carefully. &quot;Ah!<br />
  Here's ze problem! Ve chust get on I-94, turn right at<br />
  Indianapolis...&quot;<br />
  The SS trooper looked over von Liederkranz's shoulder again.<br />
  &quot;Uh, Herr Sturmbannfuhrer, dat's a map of Illinois!&quot; Von<br />
  Liederkranz started. He quickly crumpled up the map and threw it on<br />
  the ground. &quot;I know dat!&quot; He turned to the rest of the group. &quot;Ve<br />
  are going to zis town! Ve intended to go to zis town! It vas NOT a<br />
  mistake!&quot; They continued down the road, and into town.<br />
  The town consisted of one unpaved road, flanked by one story<br />
  wooden buildings with broad fronts. Their names were clearly<br />
  legible on them: SALOON, GENERAL STORE, U.S. MARSHAL. The town<br />
  looked somehow familiar to Ernie.<br />
  &quot;Oh wow!&quot; exclaimed the Fly. &quot;It's Dodge City!&quot;<br />
  &quot;That's impossible!&quot; snorted Sterno. &quot;You can't have `All<br />
  Roads Lead to Dodge City'! That's not right! I have a classical<br />
  education and I know!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Could be Abilene, I suppose,&quot; mused Ernie.<br />
  &quot;`All Roads Lead to Abilene'?&quot; said Sterno sarcastically. &quot;Fat<br />
  chance!&quot;<br />
  &quot;You must be right,&quot; Ernie agreed. &quot;I don't see any cattle<br />
  around. Must be Dodge City after all!&quot;<br />
  As they passed through town, Ernie noticed a tall, thin young<br />
  man who looked at them with alarm. The young man began hurrying<br />
  towards the U.S. Marshal's office, walking with a pronounced limp.<br />
  &quot;Mr. Dillon! Mr. Dillon! Somethin' strange comin' into town!&quot; he<br />
  cried.<br />
  A tall, imposing man, dressed in Western attire and wearing a<br />
  U.S. Marshal badge stepped out of the marshal's office and into the<br />
  street, blocking the path of the chariot. &quot;Hold up there, now! What<br />
  do you boys want in our town?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Get out of my vay!&quot; hissed von Liederkranz. &quot;I haff no time<br />
  for dis shtupidity!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Now hold on just a minute there...&quot; the Marshal began. <br />
  &quot;Idiot!&quot; snapped von Liederkranz. He turned to the SS<br />
  troopers. &quot;Disintegrate him!&quot; von Liederkranz and the SS troopers<br />
  reached for their evil-looking weapons.<br />
  With lightning speed, the Marshal's gun flew into his hand.<br />
  Four shots rand out, catching each of the Nazis full in the chest,<br />
  the force of the bullet hurling their bodies from the chariot.<br />
  &quot;I seen it, Mr. Dillon!&quot; cried Chester, the young man with the<br />
  limp. &quot;They drew first!&quot;<br />
  Ernie threw his hands up over his head. &quot;Don't shoot! We're<br />
  unarmed!&quot;<br />
  Sterno get down on all fours. &quot;Woof!&quot; he said emphatically.<br />
  &quot;They don't shoot dogs, do they?&quot;<br />
  &quot;They were holding us prisoner!&quot; the Fly chimed in. &quot;They shot<br />
  Ben-Hur!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Ben who?&quot; The Marshal looked confused. Just then, a woman in<br />
  an elaborate red dress ran out of the saloon. &quot;Oh Matt! Are you all<br />
  right? I heard the shooting...&quot;<br />
  &quot;Don't you worry, Miss Kitty, I'm just fine,&quot; the Marshal<br />
  reassured her.<br />
  Ernie looked at the ground behind him. The bloody bodies of<br />
  von Liederkranz and the other Nazis were lying motionless in the<br />
  dust.<br />
  Ernie turned to Captain Memory. &quot;Are they really...dead?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh yes,&quot; said Captain Memory cheerfully. &quot;Too bad they won't<br />
  stay that way!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Huh?&quot; Ernie was confused.<br />
  &quot;Well, you know how it is in computer games,&quot; the Captain went<br />
  on. &quot;If you get killed, you just start over again with another<br />
  life!&quot;<br />
  &quot;I dunno, they looked pretty dead to me!&quot; Ernie said.<br />
  &quot;Look again,&quot; the Captain advised.<br />
  Ernie turned. The bodies had vanished. <br />
  &quot;See?&quot; the Captain said. &quot;They've gone back to the beginning.<br />
  They'll have to start all over!&quot;<br />
  Ernie turned back to look at the Marshal, who had been<br />
  conferring with Miss Kitty and Chester. &quot;You boys are free to go,&quot;<br />
  the Marshal said. &quot;Just stay out of trouble!&quot; He went back into his<br />
  office.<br />
  &quot;Whew!&quot; the Fly breathed a sigh of relief. &quot;Boy, are we lucky<br />
  to get out of that one! You don't want to mess with Marshal<br />
  Dillon!&quot;<br />
  Sterno stood back up and brushed himself off, trying to<br />
  recover his lost dignity. &quot;You can put your hands down now,&quot; he<br />
  said to Ernie snappishly. &quot;You have no idea how ridiculous you look<br />
  surrendering when there's no-one there!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh.&quot; Ernie lowered his hands. He looked around. &quot;So, what are<br />
  we gonna do in Dodge City?&quot;<br />
  The Fly looked at the Saloon. &quot;Look at all those pretty girls<br />
  in there! Whaddya say we go in for a drink?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well...okay.&quot; Ernie couldn't think of any reason not to.<br />
  Besides, his throat was feeling pretty dusty after that long<br />
  chariot ride.<br />
  They got out of the chariot and walked towards the saloon, the<br />
  Fly leading the way. They walked up to the doors, when suddenly<br />
  their way was blocked by a burly bartender. &quot;Hold it right there,<br />
  boys! We don't allow no Injuns in here!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Huh?&quot; The Fly was confused.<br />
  &quot;That means you!&quot; The bartender prodded the Fly in the chest.<br />
  &quot;Imagine that, trying to come in here with feathers...&quot; he gestured<br />
  toward the Fly's antenna, &quot;...and a war mask!&quot; He gestured towards<br />
  the Fly's face. The dance-hall girls laughed derisively.<br />
  &quot;Hey, wait a minute!&quot; the Fly protested. &quot;I'm not...&quot;<br />
  A shotgun suddenly appeared in the bartender's hands. &quot;I said<br />
  `Git!'&quot; he said menacingly. &quot;NOW!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Okay, okay,&quot; the Fly backed off. &quot;I'm gittin'!&quot;<br />
  &quot;And don't come back!&quot; the bartender called after them.<br />
  The Fly sighed as the foursome walked back to the chariot.<br />
  &quot;Aw, gee. I never get to have any fun!&quot;<br />
</p>
<p> CHAPTER 8</p>
<p> The foursome walked slowly back towards Ben-Hur's chariot.<br />
  Suddenly, the lead horse reared up, whinnying loudly, and the four<br />
  horses galloped out of town as fast as they could run, the empty<br />
  chariot bouncing along behind them.<br />
  Ernie was totally taken aback by this. &quot;Hey, they started up<br />
  all by themselves!&quot; he said, as the cloud of dust raised by the<br />
  horse's hooves drifted over them. &quot;Can they do that?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well, obviously they can!&quot; Sterno sneered. &quot;And it's all your<br />
  fault!&quot;<br />
  &quot;MY fault!&quot; Ernie coughed. &quot;Why is it MY fault?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Because it's always your fault!&quot; Sterno snapped. &quot;YOU didn't<br />
  tie them up!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Me?&quot; Ernie protested. &quot;I didn't know you had to tie them up!<br />
  Can't you just, like, turn them off or something?&quot;<br />
  Sterno rolled his eyes upward. &quot;Hopeless!&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory looked up at the bright afternoon sun. &quot;Nice<br />
  day for a walk, don't you think?&quot;<br />
  Ernie looked down the road. It seemed to stretch endlessly<br />
  through a scrubby, dusty, semi-desert landscape. It looked exactly<br />
  like the scenery he'd seen in hundreds of episodes of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;.<br />
  It did not look like a pleasant place for a walk. &quot;Maybe we could<br />
  just stay here,&quot; he suggested hopefully.<br />
  Just then, Marshal Dillon stepped out of his office. &quot;You boys<br />
  better get movin', before you get into more trouble,&quot; he said<br />
  sternly. &quot;I want you out of town before sunset!&quot;<br />
  Ernie sighed. &quot;Well, okay, maybe we won't stay here, then.&quot;<br />
  The foursome started off down the road, occasionally glancing over<br />
  their shoulders to see if the Marshal was still watching them.<br />
  Unfortunately, he was.<br />
  After what seemed like hours, they approached a fork in the<br />
  road. One branch seemed to head off into the mountains, and another<br />
  into the valley. They stopped.<br />
  Ernie looked at both branches of the road. &quot;Well, which way do<br />
  we go? The high road or the low road?&quot;<br />
  &quot;I know!&quot; the Fly chimed in brightly. &quot;You take the high road<br />
  and I'll take the low road!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Why?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Because then I'll be in Scotland afore ye!&quot; The Fly beamed.<br />
  &quot;Gimme a break&quot;, moaned Ernie.<br />
  &quot;Wait a minute,&quot; Captain Memory interrupted.<br />
  &quot;What?&quot; Maybe the Captain could come up with something that<br />
  would get them out of this desolate landscape.<br />
  &quot;Isn't it supposed to be `you'll take the low road and I'll<br />
  take the high road?'&quot;<br />
  The Fly frowned. &quot;No, I'm sure it's supposed to be `you take<br />
  the high road and I'll take the low road'!&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory shook his head. &quot;No, I think it's the other way<br />
  around!&quot;<br />
  &quot;No, it can't be!&quot; the Fly answered. &quot;Listen!&quot; He started to<br />
  sing. &quot;You'll take the high road...&quot;<br />
  &quot;That's enough already!&quot; Sterno broke in. &quot;What difference<br />
  does it make, anyway! We're not going to Scotland!&quot;<br />
  Ernie looked around. &quot;Okay, then where are we going?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Rome!&quot; stated Sterno confidently. &quot;`All Roads Lead to Rome!'&quot;<br />
  Ernie regarded the landscape skeptically. &quot;I dunno. Rome,<br />
  that's in Italy, right? This doesn't look like Italy to me. It<br />
  looks like...&quot; He stopped.<br />
  &quot;Like what?&quot; Sterno demanded.<br />
  &quot;Like...well, well...I don't know what it looks like, but it<br />
  doesn't look like Italy.&quot;<br />
  &quot;It's pointless to argue with me,&quot; said Sterno pompously.<br />
  &quot;Because I have a classical education and I am, therefore, always<br />
  right.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Aren't there supposed to be, like, grapes, and pizzas, and<br />
  people playing those little accordions?&quot; Ernie wondered. No-one<br />
  paid any attention to him.<br />
  The Fly looked down the road into the valley, and up the road<br />
  into the mountains. &quot;Okay, so which way do we go, then?&quot;<br />
  &quot;It doesn't matter,&quot; said Sterno self-importantly. &quot;`All Roads<br />
  Lead to Rome'!&quot;<br />
  The Fly started up the road into the mountains. &quot;You guys can<br />
  go any way you want,&quot; he called back over his shoulder. &quot;But I'm<br />
  going this way!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Why?&quot; Ernie called after him.<br />
  &quot;'Cause then I'll be in Scotland afore ye!&quot; The Fly laughed<br />
  and started running. &quot;Last one there is a rotten egg!&quot;<br />
  Ernie turned to Captain Memory and Sterno. &quot;Well,&quot; he said at<br />
  last. &quot;I guess we might as well follow him.&quot;<br />
  &quot;I'll say!&quot; Captain Memory agreed. &quot;I wouldn't want him to be<br />
  in Scotland afore me!&quot; The three of them turned, and began walking<br />
  up the road into the mountains.<br />
  The road headed upward at a moderate angle, making walking<br />
  somewhat difficult. They began to notice the terrain around them<br />
  changing as they walked. They seemed to be moving into a cooler,<br />
  moister environment. The desert was giving way to cool Alpine<br />
  meadows. The road narrowed into a path, threading it's way between<br />
  the growing hills. `Actually', Ernie thought. `It's kind of nice<br />
  here. Maybe taking the high road was a good idea.'<br />
  They had not seen the Fly for quite some time, but they were<br />
  fairly confident that he was just a bit out of sight ahead of them,<br />
  since they could hear someone singing &quot;I'll take the high road...&quot;<br />
  in the distance. Suddenly, the singing stopped.<br />
  Ernie frowned. He hoped the Fly hadn't fallen over a cliff or<br />
  something. He strained his ears. No, no singing. Suddenly, he heard<br />
  another sound. &quot;Did you hear that?&quot; he said to Sterno.<br />
  &quot;Of course,&quot; said Sterno assuredly.<br />
  Ernie frowned. &quot;What did that sound like to you?&quot;<br />
  &quot;I believe it was `Yodellay-he-hoo'&quot;, Sterno replied.<br />
  Ernie knitted his brow in concentration. &quot;I've heard that<br />
  before. That reminds me of something!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Like what?&quot; asked Sterno, with a slight air of sarcasm.<br />
  &quot;Fondue, perhaps? Chocolate? Watches? `Heidi'?&quot;<br />
  Ernie brightened. &quot;Switzerland! We're in Switzerland!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Very good!&quot; applauded Sterno. &quot;Go to the head of the class!&quot;<br />
  Ernie frowned again. &quot;So, what are we doing in Switzerland?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory shrugged. &quot;We seem to have wandered into<br />
  somebody's Geography program.&quot;<br />
  &quot;So now what?&quot;<br />
  &quot;We go on to Rome, of course,&quot; Sterno answered confidently.<br />
  Ernie looked at the rising mountains and Alpine meadows around<br />
  them. &quot;Are you sure we're going the right way? I mean, are we<br />
  supposed to go through Switzerland to get to Rome?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Of course,&quot; said Sterno with great assurance. &quot;Don't you<br />
  remember Hannibal, taking his elephants through the Alps on his way<br />
  to Rome?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Hannibal!&quot; Ernie's face lit up with recognition. &quot;I saw that<br />
  movie! Starring Victor Mature, right?&quot; Ernie looked at the narrow<br />
  path on which they stood, and frowned. &quot;What are we gonna do if we<br />
  run into an elephant on this trail?&quot;<br />
  At that moment they turned a corner, and came upon the Fly,<br />
  who was standing still, looking at something. &quot;Hi, guys!&quot; he said.<br />
  &quot;Take a look at this!&quot;<br />
  The trail at this pointed rounded a curve at the top of a<br />
  cliff. The Fly pointed over the side, into the valley below. There<br />
  was some sort of commotion going on in the valley. There seemed to<br />
  be a large crowd of some sort moving through the valley, carrying<br />
  torches.<br />
  Ernie peered into the valley. There were a lot of people, or<br />
  animals, or something, moving around, but he couldn't make out what<br />
  they were doing. &quot;Another cattle drive?&quot; he suggested.<br />
  &quot;I doubt it,&quot; remarked Sterno. &quot;Look at all those torches!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Must be a torch drive!&quot; the Fly said brightly.<br />
  Sterno glared at the Fly, and muttered something<br />
  unintelligible.<br />
  &quot;Those torches sure are pretty, aren't they?&quot; commented<br />
  Captain Memory. &quot;Maybe we should go down and join the party?&quot;<br />
  Ernie could hear some kind of chanting drifting up from the<br />
  valley. He strained to hear what they were saying. It seemed to be<br />
  something like `Oom alla boom'. He frowned. Somehow, he just didn't<br />
  like the look of that crowd. &quot;Uh, maybe we'd better not,&quot; he<br />
  countered.<br />
  Sterno agreed with him. &quot;Maybe another time,&quot; the dog<br />
  suggested.<br />
  Captain Memory looked at the others. &quot;You guys are no fun,&quot; he<br />
  complained. The foursome watched the commotion below for a few<br />
  minutes, and then continued along the trail.<br />
  The narrow trail wound along between huge boulders, making it<br />
  impossible to see very far ahead. The foursome passed through a<br />
  narrow opening, and found themselves facing a large, open field,<br />
  which seemed to stretch on for miles.<br />
  In the middle of this space was a large, English-style<br />
  mansion, surrounded by carefully-tended grounds. The foursome<br />
  approached it.<br />
  A low, ornamental fence surrounded the grounds. A road led<br />
  through the fence, and up to the front door. Lacking any better<br />
  ideas, the foursome walked down the road and up to the front door.<br />
  The door was massive and imposing, with a huge cast iron door<br />
  knocker in the middle. Ernie looked at Captain Memory. Captain<br />
  Memory looked at the Fly. The Fly looked at Sterno. Sterno looked<br />
  at Ernie. Ernie looked around. Everyone was looking at him. Ernie<br />
  sighed, and stepped up to the door. Tentatively, he raised the<br />
  knocker and let it drop. It made a surprisingly loud sound. Ernie<br />
  flinched.<br />
  He waited. Nothing happened. <br />
  &quot;Try it again,&quot; Sterno demanded. <br />
  Ernie frowned. &quot;Why don't you try it?&quot; He had a bad feeling<br />
  about this place. It looked like someplace he had seen in a movie<br />
  sometime. He didn't remember what movie it was, or what happened,<br />
  but it was something bad.<br />
  &quot;Well, obviously, I'm not tall enough to reach it,&quot; said<br />
  Sterno patronizingly. &quot;Anyway, it's your job.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Why is it my job?&quot; cried Ernie indignantly. &quot;Why is it always<br />
  my job?&quot;<br />
  &quot;You started it,&quot; retorted Sterno.<br />
  Ernie sighed. He knew there would be some reason why it was<br />
  his job. He always got stuck with things like this. Who knows what<br />
  kind of horrible creature would answer the door. Even if it was a<br />
  normal person, what was he supposed to say to them, anyway? Oh<br />
  well, might as well get it over with. He raised the knocker and<br />
  slammed it down several times, raising a tremendous din that no-one<br />
  in the house could have missed. They waited.<br />
  Nothing happened.<br />
  &quot;Well, nobody's home,&quot; said Ernie lightly. &quot;I guess we might<br />
  as well go.&quot; <br />
  &quot;Oh, come ON,&quot; snapped Sterno irritatedly. &quot;Where are we<br />
  supposed to go, anyway? Try the doorknob!&quot;<br />
  Ernie shifted the coffee maker to his other hand, and gingerly<br />
  touched the huge, cast-iron doorknob, half expecting an explosion<br />
  or an electric shock. Nothing happened. He tried to turn it. It was<br />
  very securely locked, and totally unmovable.<br />
  &quot;Well, door's locked,&quot; said Ernie in a cheerful tone. &quot;Might<br />
  as well go!&quot;<br />
  &quot;We'll find another way in!&quot; said Sterno sternly. &quot;Let's walk<br />
  around the building.&quot;<br />
  Ernie grimaced. The others, however, seemed content to follow<br />
  Sterno as he headed off around the corner to the left. Ernie<br />
  supposed there was no way to get out of this, so he followed as<br />
  well, bringing up the rear.<br />
  A small garden path led around the corner of the building,<br />
  through the English garden, and to a nicely-tended stone patio.<br />
  French doors led from the house to the patio.<br />
  &quot;Just as I thought!&quot; Sterno declared. He strode purposefully<br />
  up to the doors, and tried the knob. They were unlocked. He led the<br />
  way into the house.<br />
  They found themselves in a luxurious English-style study, the<br />
  walls panelled with dark oak, and lined with shelves containing<br />
  leather-bound books. Sterno headed immediately for a small<br />
  occasional table by the wall. &quot;Aha!&quot; he cried. &quot;I knew it!&quot; He<br />
  flipped open a dark wood box, revealing a store of excellent<br />
  cigars. He grabbed a handful of them, lighting one immediately.<br />
  &quot;Ahhh!&quot; He exhaled a cloud of blue smoke. His eyes lit upon a<br />
  decanter sitting next to the humidor. &quot;Lovely!&quot; he exclaimed.<br />
  &quot;Brandy, anyone?&quot;<br />
  Ernie sighed wearily. All this stress was just too much for<br />
  him, he decided. Luckily, there was a large, overstuffed Victorian<br />
  sofa placed in the middle of the room. Ernie dropped heavily onto<br />
  it, followed by Captain Memory and the Fly.<br />
  Captain Memory scanned the room slowly. &quot;I wonder where they<br />
  keep their TV?&quot; he said pensively.<br />
  The sofa faced to large oak doors, which Ernie supposed must<br />
  lead to the rest of the house. Ernie considered them, wondering if<br />
  they should try to explore the house further. No, he decided, let's<br />
  just leave well enough alone.<br />
  At that moment the doors flew open. In the doorway stood a<br />
  tall, very British-looking gentleman, with a white handlebar<br />
  mustache, wearing a smoking jacket and a top hat. &quot;How good of you<br />
  to come!&quot; he announced jovially. &quot;I'm Lord Foofaraw. Do make<br />
  yourselves at home! Tea, anyone?&quot; A butler entered, carrying a<br />
  silver tray full of teacups, and three large, covered, silver<br />
  dishes. Ernie gratefully accepted a cup of tea, and peeked under<br />
  the covers of the dishes. The first two contained unappetizing-<br />
  looking little ornamental sandwiches. They seemed to be made of<br />
  plastic, or some other not-entirely-edible material. At this point,<br />
  however, Ernie was so ravenously hungry he would have eaten<br />
  practically anything, even items that were only marginally edible.<br />
  However, Ernie decided to check the third dish. What luck! It<br />
  contained a large pile of fresh, hot, sizzling lamb chops, broiled<br />
  to perfection. Ernie loved lamb chops. He grabbed the entire dish<br />
  off the tray and began wolfing them down, eating them with his bare<br />
  hands.<br />
  As Ernie's hunger subsided, he began to feel self-conscious.<br />
  They seemed to be having an elegant English tea with a titled<br />
  British nobleman, and here he was wearing a fur loincloth, carrying<br />
  a plastic broadsword and a coffee maker, and eating lamb chops with<br />
  his bare hands. It didn't seem proper to Ernie. Certainly it was<br />
  very un-British. Ernie frowned. Then, on the other hand, it wasn't<br />
  his fault. Lord Foofaraw was the one who served the lamb chops.<br />
  They shouldn't serve lamb chops if they don't want people to eat<br />
  them. And anyway, they didn't give him any utensils, so he had to<br />
  eat them with his hands. That settled, Ernie returned to stuffing<br />
  his face with chops.<br />
  &quot;Pip, pip! Cheerio! Eh, wot?&quot; said Lord Foofaraw jovially. <br />
  &quot;How very British!&quot; exclaimed Sterno delightedly.<br />
  &quot;Rather!&quot; agreed Lord Foofaraw.<br />
  Ernie turned to the nobleman. &quot;I wonder if you could tell us<br />
  where we are?&quot; he managed to ask between bites.<br />
  &quot;Where you ARE?&quot; Lord Foofaraw seemed amazed. &quot;Why, I should<br />
  think that would be quite obvious! You're HERE, old boy!&quot;<br />
  Sterno chuckled. The Fly waved his antennae confusedly.<br />
  Captain Memory continued to look around for a TV.<br />
  Lord Foofaraw settled comfortably  into an overstuffed chair.<br />
  &quot;Ah yes,&quot; he began. &quot;This reminds me of the time I was lost in the<br />
  jungles of Poodawumpus, surrounded by cannibals!&quot; He leaned forward<br />
  animatedly. &quot;There were cannibals to the right of me, cannibals to<br />
  the left of me! The light of their torches flickered through the<br />
  dense undergrowth. I could hear their infernal chanting: `Oom alla<br />
  boom! Oom alla boom!' Over and over, until I thought the infernal<br />
  din should surely drive me mad! Suddenly, I....&quot; He broke off,<br />
  looking at Ernie oddly. &quot;I say, my good man, why ever are you<br />
  carrying that coffee maker?&quot;<br />
  Ernie fidgeted uncomfortably. &quot;It's not a coffee maker, it's<br />
  a Psion Megaforce Generator.&quot;<br />
  &quot;A WOT?&quot; the lord was amazed.<br />
  &quot;A Psion Megaforce Generator!&quot; Ernie repeated. Lord Foofaraw<br />
  looked at him skeptically. Ernie looked again at the device he was<br />
  carrying. He sighed. &quot;On the other hand, it could be a coffee maker<br />
  too, I suppose.&quot; Ernie admitted. &quot;Anyway, it's genuine Bakelite!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Ah, yes! Bakelite!&quot; the lord seemed to consider this answer<br />
  reasonable. A faraway look came into his eyes. &quot;That reminds me of<br />
  the time I was trekking through the desert of Duzzlebuggy...&quot;<br />
  &quot;But, what about the cannibals?&quot; the Fly broke in, his<br />
  antennae waving excitedly.<br />
  &quot;Don't interrupt His Lordship!&quot; snapped Sterno.<br />
  Lord Foofaraw looked confused. &quot;I say, old man, there are no<br />
  cannibals in the deserts of Duzzlebuggy!&quot;<br />
  The Fly's antennae drooped disappointedly. &quot;I wanted to hear<br />
  about the cannibals!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, dear!&quot; The lord seemed quite flustered by all these<br />
  interruptions. &quot;Where was I? Ah, yes, there I was, scaling the<br />
  mountains of Muffiedump....&quot;<br />
  Ernie's mind wandered. He noticed a beautiful silver bell<br />
  sitting on an end table next to him. It seemed to be a very unusual<br />
  design. It was covered with dozens of tiny pushbuttons, each with<br />
  an odd little symbol next to it. Ernie picked it up curiously.<br />
  &quot;BONG! BONG!&quot; Loud, synthesized bell-sounds appeared as though<br />
  out of nowhere.<br />
  Lord Foofaraw looked up in annoyance, stopping his story in<br />
  mid-sentence. &quot;I say, my good man! Whatever ARE you doing?&quot;<br />
  Ernie looked up disconcertedly. &quot;I...um..it...&quot;  The bell<br />
  continued to bong loudly.<br />
  &quot;How RUDE!&quot; Sterno glared at Ernie.<br />
  Ernie examined the bell frantically, trying to figure out how<br />
  to turn it off. He could see now that is wasn't a real bell, but<br />
  rather an electronic, synthesized bell, with orchestral sounds, a<br />
  rhythm machine, and full MIDI capability. <br />
  Ernie pushed the tiny buttons frenziedly, desperately trying<br />
  to turn the thing off. The sound changed. &quot;Chick-a-Boom! Chick-a-<br />
  BOOM!&quot; Ernie had accidentally turned on the rhythm machine.<br />
  The door to the study opened. The Butler entered, a swarthy<br />
  character who looked somehow familiar to Ernie. The sound abruptly<br />
  stopped. Ernie breathed a sigh of relief.<br />
  The Butler looked at Ernie, and then at Lord Foofaraw. &quot;Chu<br />
  rang?&quot; he enquired.<br />
  &quot;Ah, yes!&quot; Lord Foofaraw seemed to have regained his<br />
  composure. &quot;More tea, Richard!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Chure!&quot; the Butler said agreeably, and began refilling their<br />
  cups.<br />
  His Lordship resumed his story. &quot;...and there I was,<br />
  surrounded by techno-savages! They had decided to sacrifice a<br />
  virgin, but the first one they selected was discovered to be, how<br />
  shall I say, damaged, so they were obliged to move on to the next,<br />
  who became Virgin 2.0. But she was found to be not entirely<br />
  suitable, so they settled upon Virgin 2.1, revised....&quot;<br />
  It seemed to have gotten dark outside, although they had<br />
  hardly noticed it, since the Butler, or someone, had turned on the<br />
  lights. That was odd, Ernie thought, because it had been the middle<br />
  of the afternoon only a few minutes ago. He was going to consider<br />
  it further, when abruptly, the lights went out, plunging them all<br />
  into total darkness.<br />
  From out of nowhere, a gust of wind blew up, throwing the<br />
  French doors open violently.<br />
  Suddenly, a shot rang out. They heard a cry, and a body fell<br />
  heavily to the floor.<br />
  The lights came on again. There, in the middle of the Persian<br />
  carpet, Lord Foofaraw lay dead in a pool of blood. Nearby lay a<br />
  smoking gun. Ernie was stunned. Before he could even think of what<br />
  to do, the oak doors leading to the rest of the house flew open,<br />
  and a man in a trench coat and a fedora strode purposefully in.<br />
  &quot;Scotland Yard!&quot; he announced. &quot;No-one leave this room!&quot;<br />
  A crowd of Bobbies seemed to have materialized outside of both<br />
  sets of doors. Clearly, no-one was going to be able to leave this<br />
  room until the detective was ready to allow it.<br />
  Ernie frowned. This was beginning to remind him an awful lot<br />
  of some movie or other, although he still couldn't remember which<br />
  one it was.<br />
  &quot;Oh, I remember this!&quot; Captain Memory exclaimed delightedly.<br />
  &quot;This is a game called `MYSTERY', you know, one of those who-dunnit<br />
  things? We have to solve the mystery!&quot; The captain seemed very<br />
  pleased. &quot;This is great fun!&quot;<br />
  The detective scanned all of their faces carefully. &quot;So, here<br />
  we all are, at last!&quot; he said.<br />
  `At last?' Ernie thought. &quot;Uh, we only just got here,&quot; Ernie<br />
  said tentatively, wiping his greasy hands on his fur loincloth.<br />
  &quot;And we really don't know anything about this, so, if you don't<br />
  mind, we'll just be on our...&quot; He started to get up.<br />
  &quot;Sit DOWN!&quot; shouted the detective. &quot;No-one leaves until I say<br />
  so!&quot;<br />
  Ernie sat. He hadn't really thought he was going to get away<br />
  with that, but he'd though he'd give it a try anyway.<br />
  &quot;So,&quot; the detective continued. &quot;We know you all had a reason<br />
  for wanting Lord Foofaraw dead!&quot;<br />
  The foursome all looked at one another. Ernie shrugged.<br />
  Captain Memory shrugged. The Fly shrugged. Sterno shrugged, in a<br />
  very un-doglike manner.<br />
  &quot;Well, actually,&quot; Ernie began tentatively. &quot;No, I...&quot;<br />
  &quot;A likely story!&quot; interrupted the detective. &quot;Here you are,<br />
  wearing a fur loincloth and a plastic broadsword, carrying...&quot; He<br />
  cocked an eye quizzically at Ernie, &quot;...a coffee maker? And you<br />
  expect me to believe a story like that? And just WHERE did you get<br />
  that bag of gold, anyway?&quot;<br />
  Ernie began to feel very self-conscious. He decided that<br />
  perhaps he had better keep his mouth shut. It didn't seem to him<br />
  that saying `Attila the Hun gave it to me' would go over very well.<br />
  &quot;And what about those LAMB CHOPS?!&quot; the detective thundered.<br />
  &quot;Everyone knows that one never serves lamb chops for tea! So, just<br />
  what is the meaning of all this?&quot; Ernie shrank down into his seat.<br />
  &quot;And YOU!&quot; The detective jabbed a finger at the Fly, who<br />
  flinched. &quot;You blamed Lord Foofaraw for your terrible accident,<br />
  didn't you? The accident that left you horribly disfigured, and<br />
  left Lord Foofaraw free to start an affair with YOUR WIFE!&quot; <br />
  &quot;But, but, I don't even have a wife!&quot; The Fly began, his<br />
  antennae waving in consternation.<br />
  &quot;All these years you've plotted revenge, haven't you?&quot; the<br />
  detective continued. &quot;And now, suddenly, mysteriously, Lord<br />
  Foofaraw turns up DEAD! What are we to make of THAT, my fine Fly<br />
  friend?&quot;<br />
  &quot;But, but....&quot; The Fly's antennae waved wildly.<br />
  The detective, however, had already gone on to the next<br />
  suspect.<br />
  &quot;And YOU!&quot; He jabbed a finger at Sterno. &quot;You've had no reward<br />
  for years of faithful service, have you? You've worked like a dog,<br />
  running and fetching every time his Lordship snapped his fingers.<br />
  We know how you resented it, how you longed to even the score. Yet,<br />
  year after year you let his Lordship treat you like an animal, with<br />
  never a whimper of complaint. And NOW, here you are, helping<br />
  yourself to his Lordship's best brandy and cigars! What would his<br />
  Lordship have thought of THAT!?&quot;<br />
  Sterno thought fast. &quot;Woof!&quot; he answered. The detective,<br />
  however, had already gone on to the next suspect.<br />
  &quot;And finally,&quot; the detective said, leaving a pregnant pause,<br />
  &quot;we have YOU!&quot; He jabbed a finger in Captain Memory's face. &quot;The<br />
  famous Captain Memory! `Through Space and Time Without a Dime' I<br />
  think you've been heard to say!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Actually, I sort of prefer `Through Time and Space to a<br />
  Better Place'&quot;, answered the Captain conversationally.<br />
  &quot;A likely story!&quot; snapped the detective. &quot;We know what you've<br />
  been up to! We see you when you're sleeping! We know if you're<br />
  awake! We know if you've been bad or good, so be...&quot; He stopped<br />
  abruptly, glancing suspiciously about him. &quot;Never mind! The<br />
  question here is: just exactly how do you JUMP out of sectors that<br />
  aren't supposed to accept any external commands, anyway?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory frowned. &quot;What does that have to do with Lord<br />
  Foofaraw?&quot;<br />
  &quot;You know very well what it has to do with the case!&quot; snapped<br />
  the detective. &quot;Just answer the question!&quot;<br />
  Suddenly, a light went on in Ernie's head. He suddenly<br />
  remembered how all the pieces fit together. &quot;I know!&quot; he shouted.<br />
  &quot;The BUTLER DID IT!&quot;<br />
  The butler blanched. &quot;Hey, mon!&quot; he cried out. &quot;What chu<br />
  talkin' about? I don' do nothin'!&quot;<br />
  The detective looked irritated. &quot;Don't change the subject!&quot; he<br />
  snapped. He turned back to Captain Memory. &quot;Awright, youse guys!<br />
  Talk! Youse guys ain't gonna play me for a patsy!&quot;<br />
  Ernie and the Fly looked at each other in confusion. <br />
  The detective continued. &quot;You lousy two-bit gunsels think you<br />
  can take a rod and...&quot; One of the Bobbies came in hurriedly, tapped<br />
  the detective on the shoulder, and whispered something in his ear.<br />
  &quot;What...?!&quot; the detective snapped. He laughed nervously. &quot;Oh.<br />
  Right. BRITISH detective.&quot; He laughed again. &quot;Pip pip! Cheerio! Eh,<br />
  wot?&quot;<br />
  Ernie frowned. There was something very suspicious about this<br />
  detective. For one thing, his large, British-style handlebar<br />
  mustache did not seem to be attached to his face very well. It was<br />
  slowly drooping off one side of his face. There was something funny<br />
  about his clothes, too. The trenchcoat was okay, the hat was<br />
  okay...Maybe it was the jackboots?<br />
  Sterno gave the detective a pitiless glare. &quot;You lost your<br />
  character!&quot; he accused. <br />
  The detective laughed nervously. &quot;Character? Vot character?<br />
  I'm not a character, I'm...uh...&quot; He looked flustered. He elbowed<br />
  the bobby next to him. &quot;Quick!&quot; he whispered. &quot;Who am I?&quot; The bobby<br />
  whispered something in his ear. <br />
  The detective seemed to recover his composure somewhat. &quot;Oh,<br />
  yes! Of course! I'm the famous British detective, Thomas Cheddar!&quot;<br />
  Sterno's fur stood on end. &quot; Oh, no! It's cheese! CHEESE!<br />
  RUN!&quot; he wailed.<br />
  But it was too late. The detective whipped an evil-looking<br />
  weapon out from under his raincoat, which parted to reveal a black<br />
  SS uniform beneath it. &quot;Enough of zis shtupidity!&quot; he cried,<br />
  holding the foursome at bay. &quot;You vill perhaps recognize me now,&quot;<br />
  he said confidently. He screwed a monocle into one eye, and whipped<br />
  off the false handlebar mustache with a flourish. He immediately<br />
  regretted this, and winced with pain as the glue on the false<br />
  mustache tore out half the hairs of his real mustache. He quickly<br />
  regained his composure, however, and waited for some response from<br />
  the foursome.<br />
  Captain Memory looked at Ernie. Ernie shrugged.<br />
  The detective looked from one to the other. &quot;You DO recognize<br />
  me, ja?&quot; he asked, a bit uncertainly.<br />
  &quot;I'm sure we've seen you someplace before,&quot; said Sterno<br />
  patronizingly.<br />
  &quot;Of course,&quot; agreed Captain Memory. &quot;It's on the tip of my<br />
  tongue! It's...uh...&quot; He trailed off.<br />
  The Fly's antennae waved uncertainly. Suddenly, he brightened.<br />
  &quot;Oh, I get it! It's a game, right? First syllable? Sounds like?&quot; He<br />
  began gesticulating wildly. &quot;I know! I know! It's Fred Astaire,<br />
  right? Fred Astaire?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Enough!&quot; the detective shouted angrily. &quot;I cannot believe dat<br />
  you do not recognize me, Sturmbannfuhrer Dr. Heinz von Liederkranz,<br />
  de most famous Nazi in all Televisionland. Obviously, you haff<br />
  recognized me all along, and you are chust toying vith me. Vell,&quot;<br />
  he smiled evilly. &quot;Ve shall see who toys vis who!&quot;<br />
  Sterno frowned. &quot;Whom,&quot; he corrected.<br />
  &quot;Vot?!&quot; snapped von Liederkranz.<br />
  &quot;Whom,&quot; Sterno continued. &quot;It's not `who toys with who', it's<br />
  `who toys with whom'.&quot;<br />
  Von Liederkranz's monocle dropped out of his eye. &quot;Was fur ein<br />
  shtupid language! I haff no time for dis! We must get on vis de<br />
  questioning!&quot; He smiled evilly.<br />
  &quot;Okay,&quot; said Captain Memory agreeably. &quot;Why do fools fall in<br />
  love?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Nein, dummkopf!&quot; von Liederkranz shrieked. &quot;I ask ze<br />
  questions!&quot;<br />
  The Fly sulked. &quot;Why do you always get to ask the questions?<br />
  How come we never get to ask any questions?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Quite right!&quot; Sterno asserted. &quot;And why must you always wear<br />
  that dreadful uniform?&quot;<br />
  Von Liederkranz stopped, startled. &quot;Uniform? Vot's wrong vis<br />
  my uniform?&quot;<br />
  &quot;I mean, really!&quot; Sterno sniffed. &quot;It's hardly the thing for<br />
  High Tea, is it? I should think a top hat...&quot;<br />
  &quot;Puttink on a top hat?&quot; von Liederkranz asked incredulously.<br />
  &quot;White tie, tails...&quot; Sterno went on.<br />
  &quot;Puttink on a white tie?&quot; The Nazi seemed amazed.<br />
  &quot;PUTTING ON THE RITZ!&quot; The Fly shouted joyously, finishing the<br />
  line of the song. &quot;I knew it! I knew it was Fred Astaire!&quot;<br />
  Von Liederkranz drew himself up to his full height. &quot;Ja, I DO<br />
  look a great deal like your Fred Astaire, nein?&quot; Of course, he<br />
  didn't look anything like Fred Astaire, but no-one wanted to be the<br />
  one to tell him that.<br />
  &quot;Oh yes,&quot; Sterno enthused insincerely. &quot;You've all the<br />
  elegance, all the grace of the greatest dancer of all time!&quot;<br />
  Von Liederkranz preened. &quot;Ja, dat's right! I do!&quot; Looking<br />
  down, he noticed Lord Foofaraw's top hat, which had rolled off his<br />
  head when he collapsed, dead. He picked it up, tossing his own<br />
  military cap aside. Using Lord Foofaraw's top hat and his own<br />
  riding crop as a cane, he attempted to do a Fred Astaire-style top-<br />
  hat-and-cane number. He began to do a few awkward, shuffling dance<br />
  steps. &quot;Puttink on mein top hat...&quot; he began to sing.<br />
  The `Bobbies' had by now shed their English policeman uniforms<br />
  to reveal their Nazi uniforms beneath. They  were totally confused<br />
  by this turn of events. They shuffled about awkwardly, not knowing<br />
  what to do.<br />
  Von Liederkranz glared at them. &quot;Sing!&quot; he commanded. The<br />
  Nazi's lined up and formed a chorus line, swaying with the music,<br />
  singing off key &quot;...puttink on mein white tie...&quot;<br />
  Von Liederkranz attempted to do some slightly more complicated<br />
  steps, but succeeded only in knocking over the silver tray, sending<br />
  the tea cups and little plastic sandwiches crashing to the ground.<br />
  This threw the other Nazi's off their rhythm. Half of them<br />
  swayed left, and half swayed right, causing them to violently bump<br />
  into each other, knocking some off their feet. Their voices trailed<br />
  off.<br />
  &quot;Sing!&quot; von Liederkranz commanded ferociously.<br />
  The Nazi's resumed singing with feigned enthusiasm. &quot;PUTTINK<br />
  ON DER RITZ!!<br />
  &quot;I knew it!&quot; the Fly enthused. &quot;I knew it was Fred Astaire!<br />
  That means I win, right?&quot;<br />
  Von Liederkranz and the Nazis began dancing gracelessly<br />
  towards the door that led to the hallway, singing &quot;Dum de dum de<br />
  dum dum....&quot; since they couldn't remember the rest of the words. <br />
  &quot;Bravo!&quot; Sterno applauded enthusiastically. &quot;Keep it up,<br />
  you're doing great!&quot;<br />
  Von Liederkranz grinned broadly and began dancing with greater<br />
  enthusiasm, although no better rhythm. He headed out the door and<br />
  down the hall, the Nazi chorus line crowding awkwardly behind him. <br />
  &quot;Fabulous!&quot; Sterno enthused. He signalled to Ernie, the Fly,<br />
  and Captain Memory, who caught the hint and began applauding as<br />
  well. &quot;Wonderful! Tremendous!&quot; they all cheered.<br />
  The Nazi's voices began receding down the hall. Sterno<br />
  gestured towards the French doors leading to the outside. The four<br />
  got up, and began tiptoeing towards them.<br />
  Suddenly, the heard a resounding crash coming from down the<br />
  hall. &quot;Dummkopf! Schweinhund!&quot; cried a voice, followed by the snap<br />
  of a riding crop. <br />
  &quot;RUN!&quot; cried Sterno. The foursome charged through the French<br />
  doors and went sprinting across the field behind the house.<br />
  In a few moments, the English Tudor mansion was out of view.<br />
  Peculiarly enough, as soon as they left the mansion it was mid-<br />
  afternoon again. The darkness seemed to have been confined to the<br />
  study. The four slowed down to a walk, exhausted and out of breath.<br />
  Ernie looked back. There was no sign of pursuit.<br />
  &quot;Looks like they're still trying to get their act together,&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory commented.<br />
  &quot;That act has got, let's say, a few rough spots that need to<br />
  be ironed out,&quot; Sterno snickered. &quot;I think they're going to be<br />
  working on it for rather a long time.&quot; <br />
  Ernie sighed with relief. Those Nazis made him very uneasy.<br />
  The four continued walking. They were in the midst of what<br />
  seemed to be many acres of lush, grassy meadow. A short distance<br />
  ahead Ernie spotted flock of sheep peacefully grazing.<br />
  &quot;Sheep!&quot; Ernie exclaimed.<br />
  &quot;Really?&quot; Sterno asked sarcastically. &quot;How clever of you to<br />
  figure that out!&quot;<br />
  A small group of sheep detached themselves from the flock and<br />
  walked up to the foursome. Ernie noticed that they looked much like<br />
  the other sheep in the flock, except for the fact that they were<br />
  wearing dark sunglasses. Looking closely, he could see that some of<br />
  them seemed to be carrying some objects that looked a lot like....,<br />
  hmm, well, like surfboards. &quot;Baa!&quot; the first sheep said, as if in<br />
  greeting.<br />
  &quot;Baa Baa!&quot; Sterno replied. The sheep seemed to respond<br />
  favorably to this.<br />
  &quot;You speak their language?&quot; Ernie was astounded.<br />
  &quot;Of course,&quot; Sterno replied offhandedly. &quot;I was always a great<br />
  student of foreign languages.&quot;<br />
  &quot;But, what language do they speak?&quot; Ernie wanted to know.<br />
  &quot;Sheepish, of course,&quot; Sterno replied in a patronizing tone.<br />
  &quot;Everybody knows THAT!&quot;<br />
  The lead sheep continued. &quot;Baa Baa Baa!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Ba?&quot; inquired Sterno.<br />
  &quot;Baa Baa Baa!&quot; the lead sheep repeated vigorously.<br />
  A second later, the next sheep repeated the same thing, &quot;Baa<br />
  Baa Baa!&quot; And then the next sheep picked up the refrain; soon they<br />
  were all chanting &quot;Baa Baa Baa.&quot; Suddenly, the lead sheep launched<br />
  into the main verse: &quot;Baa Baa Baa, Baa Barbara Ann....&quot; <br />
  &quot;Oh, it's the Beach Sheep!&quot; the Fly exclaimed.<br />
  By now the entire group of sheep had launched into the song,<br />
  in full chorus. &quot;They're not bad,&quot; admitted Ernie. <br />
  &quot;Even the President likes the Beach Sheep,&quot; the Fly asserted.<br />
  &quot;Of course, they're not really the Beach Sheep,&quot; Sterno<br />
  explained.<br />
  &quot;They're not?&quot; the Fly seemed very disappointed.<br />
  &quot;Don't be silly!&quot; Sterno sniggered. &quot;You couldn't expect the<br />
  real Beach Sheep to be performing in a little, out-of-the-way<br />
  meadow like this, could you? The only play the really big fields<br />
  nowadays!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Aww!&quot; The Fly's antennae drooped.<br />
  &quot;No,&quot; continued Sterno. &quot;They're just one of a whole flock of<br />
  Beach Sheep impersonators. A good imitation, but not the real<br />
  thing.&quot;<br />
  Ernie thought a moment. &quot;You mean, like Elvis impersonators?&quot; <br />
  &quot;The Sheepish equivalent,&quot; Sterno agreed.<br />
  Having finished their song, the Beach Sheep began discussing<br />
  something with Sterno in very serious tones. Ernie, of course,<br />
  couldn't understand a bleat of it, since it was all in Sheepish.<br />
  &quot;So, what's the deal?&quot; the Fly wanted to know.<br />
  &quot;It seems the sheep have a problem,&quot; Sterno explained.<br />
  &quot;They're being oppressed by one of their own kind, a cruel tyrant<br />
  who will stop at nothing to get his own way.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Gee, that's tough,&quot; the Fly shook his head sadly.<br />
  &quot;What's this tyrant called, anyway?&quot; Ernie was curious.<br />
  Sterno paused dramatically. &quot;They call him....the Wooly<br />
  Bully!&quot;<br />
  Ernie frowned. That name seemed somehow familiar to him.<br />
  The Fly started snapping his fingers and humming. &quot;Wooly<br />
  bully, wooly bully...&quot;<br />
  &quot;Will you STOP that!&quot; barked Sterno. &quot;Have some respect,<br />
  please! This is a serious problem!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh. Sorry.&quot; The Fly fell silent. <br />
  Sterno continued conversing with the sheep. &quot;They're asking<br />
  our help in breaking free of this awful tyranny.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Wooly Bully, that reminds me of something.&quot; Captain Memory<br />
  became thoughtful. &quot;The Hully Gully, perhaps?&quot;<br />
  The Fly's antennae perked up. &quot;The Frug? The Jerk? The Mashed<br />
  Potato?&quot; he suggested.<br />
  &quot;The Swim?&quot; Sterno added. &quot;Or even, The TWIST?&quot;<br />
  A brilliant idea occurred to Ernie. &quot;I know! This must be `The<br />
  Land of 1,000 Dances!'&quot;<br />
  Sterno turned to Ernie with a look of utter disgust. &quot;Look,<br />
  we've been through this before, remember? `Fondue, chocolate,<br />
  watches, `Heidi'', remember?&quot;<br />
  Ernie became subdued. &quot;You're trying to tell me this is<br />
  Switzerland, right?&quot;<br />
  The Fly's antennae twitched excitedly. &quot;Oh, I remember that<br />
  now! `Land of 1,000 Dances!' That was a song by Cannibal and the<br />
  Headhunters!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Cannibal...&quot; Ernie started. He thought for a moment. &quot;On the<br />
  other hand,&quot; he went on. &quot;Switzerland is fine! Chocolate,<br />
  `Heidi'..... Fine, just fine!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well!&quot; Sterno sniffed. &quot;I'm glad THAT'S settled!&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory looked at his wrist. &quot;Watches? Did you say<br />
  watches?&quot;<br />
  Ernie looked at the sheep. He noticed that each of them wore<br />
  rather a nice Swiss watch on one of their front forelegs.<br />
  Captain Memory continued to look at his bare wrist, and<br />
  sighed. &quot;Oh dear, I'm afraid it's getting late. We'll have to be<br />
  going!&quot;<br />
  Ernie was nonplussed. &quot;Aren't we supposed to, like, help them<br />
  overthrow the evil ruler, or something?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory shrugged. &quot;It's not my problem, you know? I<br />
  mean, we can't do everything!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Baa Baa!&quot; said the lead sheep insistently.<br />
  &quot;The sheep wants to know,&quot; Sterno translated. &quot;If you can't<br />
  help overthrow the Wooly Bully, could you at least give him some<br />
  clue as to the whereabouts of his daughter? She's been missing<br />
  since yesterday, and he's afraid something terrible might have<br />
  happened to her, the poor little lamb!&quot;<br />
  Ernie burped. Everyone turned to look at him. &quot;Uh, who, me? I<br />
  don't know anything about it! Why would I know anything about it?&quot;<br />
  He fidgeted uncomfortably, compulsively wiping his still-greasy<br />
  hands on his fur loincloth. &quot;Stop looking at me like that!&quot; <br />
  &quot;I think we'd better get going!&quot; said Captain Memory<br />
  decisively. &quot;Now!&quot;<br />
  The four turned to leave. Ernie looked back at the group of<br />
  sheep. He smiled weakly, trying to think of something nice to say<br />
  in Sheepish. &quot;Ba!&quot; he waved good-bye.<br />
  The lead sheep started, and rose up on his hind legs looking<br />
  very angry and offended.<br />
  &quot;That was very rude!&quot; Sterno reproved Ernie.<br />
  &quot;Uh, what did I say?&quot; asked Ernie, bewildered. &quot;I only<br />
  meant...&quot;<br />
  &quot;After ALL!&quot; Sterno continued. &quot;You've never even met his<br />
  mother! And even if you had, I seriously doubt she would have<br />
  consented to do anything like that with YOU!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Gee, I'm sorry, I...&quot; Ernie decided that perhaps the safest<br />
  thing to do was simply be quiet.<br />
  The four continued walking. Ernie noticed that it seemed to be<br />
  getting warmer. Substantially more humid, too. Even though he was<br />
  wearing only a loincloth, Ernie began to perspire. The others also<br />
  seemed to be feeling uncomfortable from the heat. All except<br />
  Captain Memory, who never seemed to be uncomfortable at all.<br />
  As the sun began to set, Ernie noticed that the vegetation<br />
  around them was different, now. The warm area they were heading<br />
  into seemed to full of tropical plants. Lush flowers and tall trees<br />
  loomed ahead of them. In fact, they seemed to heading into a<br />
  jungle. <br />
  Ernie noticed an object lying in the grass. It appeared to be<br />
  the broken remnants of a vandalized sign of some sort. Ernie could<br />
  just barely make out a few words through the layers of graffiti.<br />
  &quot;Pooda....something,&quot; Ernie read. &quot;No alcoholic beverages allowed.<br />
  Do not feed the...&quot; The rest was gone. Something about it made<br />
  Ernie feel very uncomfortable.<br />
  &quot;Um, is it really a good idea to be heading into the jungle at<br />
  night?&quot; Ernie asked nervously.<br />
  &quot;Oh, you're right,&quot; said Sterno sarcastically. &quot;Let's just<br />
  check into a Holiday Inn instead!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well, it's just that it's awfully, well...dark,&quot; Ernie<br />
  fidgeted.<br />
  &quot;It gets that way at night,&quot; Sterno pointed out. &quot;You know of<br />
  some way to prevent it, perhaps?&quot;<br />
  Ernie eyed the thick jungle vegetation ahead of them with<br />
  misgivings. &quot;What if there's, um, hostile natives or something?&quot;<br />
  At that exact moment, drums began pounding in the distance.<br />
  Ernie began to feel very uneasy. &quot;Do we have to go in there?&quot; he<br />
  pleaded.<br />
  &quot;No, not at all,&quot; Captain Memory pointed out. &quot;We can just<br />
  stay here and wait for the Nazis to catch up with us, if you like!&quot;<br />
  Ernie moaned. &quot;No, that's okay. Let's just keep going!&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory shook his head sadly. &quot;I dunno, nothing seems<br />
  to make you happy! You don't want to go, you don't want to stay...<br />
  You know, you really need to have a more positive attitude!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Yeah, right,&quot; Ernie grunted. They continued along the way<br />
  into the jungle. The vegetation seemed to swallow them up. The<br />
  heavy masses of green foliage on all sides seemed to offer little<br />
  possibility of escape. The continued along the trail, which became<br />
  ever narrower as they progressed.<br />
  &quot;Look!&quot; the Fly pointed ahead. It was now almost night. The<br />
  jungle before them was almost pitch black. However, off to the left<br />
  small points of light could be seen, weaving and bobbing in and out<br />
  of the foliage in the distance.<br />
  &quot;What's that?&quot; Ernie wanted to know. &quot;Fireflies?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Torches!&quot; the Fly corrected. &quot;It's those villagers we saw in<br />
  the mountains! They've come to meet us! Isn't that nice?&quot;<br />
  Ernie was still uneasy. &quot;Are you sure they're friendly<br />
  villagers?&quot;<br />
  The Fly peered into the distance. &quot;They sure LOOK friendly! It<br />
  looks like they're having a party! They're all singing and<br />
  dancing!&quot;<br />
  As the villagers approached, Ernie began to be able to make<br />
  out what they were singing. They were chanting rhythmically to the<br />
  beat of the drums. &quot;Na, na na na na, na na na na,...&quot;<br />
  Ernie frowned. &quot;I KNOW that song! It's, um it's....&quot;<br />
  &quot;Sure!&quot; the Fly broke in. &quot;`Land of 1,000 Dances'! What a<br />
  great song!&quot;<br />
  &quot;AHA!&quot; cried Ernie. &quot;See, I told you! I was right!&quot; He turned<br />
  to Sterno. &quot;See? This is The Land of 1,000 Dances! I was right<br />
  after all!&quot;<br />
  &quot;You were not!&quot; sniffed Sterno. &quot;That was there, this is here!<br />
  That was Switzerland, this is the Land of 1,000 Dances!&quot;<br />
  Ernie sulked. &quot;Well, I was sort of right! Anyway, this is The<br />
  Land of 1,000 Dances, so those guys with the torches must be...&quot; He<br />
  suddenly turned pale. &quot;CANNIBAL AND THE HEADHUNTERS!!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Cool!&quot; agreed the Fly. &quot;Great band, huh?&quot;<br />
  &quot;What are we gonna DO!?&quot; wailed Ernie.<br />
  Suddenly, they were distracted by a loud crashing in the<br />
  forest behind them. &quot;Gottverdammter! Schweinhund!&quot; The crack of a<br />
  riding crop could clearly be heard. They turned to see bright<br />
  fingers of white light, as though from high-powered flashlights,<br />
  probing through the foliage.<br />
  &quot;Zey must be in here somevhere!&quot; they heard a voice call out.<br />
  &quot;Ze trail of isotope tracers from ze radioactive lamb chops leads<br />
  right zis vay!&quot;<br />
  Ernie pressed his hands to his stomach. &quot;I don't feel good,&quot;<br />
  he moaned.<br />
  Ernie looked up to find the other three glaring at him. &quot;How<br />
  was I to know the lamb chops were radioactive?&quot; he protested<br />
  loudly. &quot;Do you think I would have eaten them if I knew?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Ssh!&quot; The four heard the voice behind them call out. &quot;I tink<br />
  I hear zem!&quot; Ernie quickly put a hand over his mouth.<br />
  Up ahead, the bobbing torchlights were weaving ever closer.<br />
  The pounding drums and chanting was getting louder. The chanting<br />
  had changed now. &quot;Oom alla Boom!&quot; Ernie could hear. &quot;Oom alla<br />
  BOOM!&quot; From behind, the searchlights were weaving ever more in<br />
  their direction, slowly beginning to focus in on their position.<br />
  Ernie whimpered quietly.<br />
  &quot;Hey guys, look at this!&quot; the Fly pointed to something in the<br />
  darkness. Off to the right, visible only to the Fly's huge insect<br />
  eyes, a faint trail split off from the main path. &quot;Let's try this!&quot;<br />
  The Fly hurried down the trail. The others followed as closely as<br />
  possible, so as not to get lost in the increasing darkness.<br />
  The four scampered along the dark, narrow path, attempting to<br />
  move quickly, but also quietly, and not doing a very good job of<br />
  either. The sounds of pursuit behind them seem to grow ever louder.<br />
  The trail led to a large clearing, and then stopped.<br />
  Surrounding the clearing was an impenetrable thicket of thorn<br />
  bushes. In the middle of the clearing was a large iron pot, big<br />
  enough for all four of them to fit into at the same time. It sat on<br />
  a large pile of neatly arranged firewood. A heap of neatly cut-up<br />
  potatoes and carrots lay nearby.<br />
  &quot;I don't like the looks of this,&quot; Ernie moaned. He turned to<br />
  Captain Memory. &quot;Can't you get us out of here?&quot; he pleaded.<br />
  Captain Memory frowned. He seemed lost in thought. &quot;Well, I<br />
  suppose it's worth a try,&quot; he said dubiously. With that, he turned<br />
  suddenly and slugged Ernie in the stomach, hard.<br />
  &quot;Oof!&quot; Ernie doubled over in pain. &quot;Hey, what....BEEP BEEP<br />
  BEEP!&quot; Ernie was astounded at the sounds coming out of his mouth.<br />
  &quot;Good!&quot; Captain Memory cheered. &quot;It still works!&quot;<br />
  Ernie coughed. &quot;What..what still works?&quot;<br />
  &quot;The remote!&quot; Captain Memory seemed particularly cheerful. &quot;I<br />
  just remembered that a Franglian remote will still work, even if<br />
  you eat it! Quality construction, you know!&quot; He nodded wisely. &quot;I<br />
  paid a little extra, but it was worth it!&quot;<br />
  The Captain regarded Ernie carefully. &quot;The only problem is,<br />
  it's a little hard to press the buttons! Let me see...&quot; Without<br />
  warning, he elbowed Ernie violently in the kidneys.<br />
  Ernie fell to the ground in pain. He opened his mouth: &quot;BEEP<br />
  BOOP!&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory looked embarrassed. &quot;Oh, sorry. Wrong button!&quot;<br />
  The toe of his boot slammed into Ernie's ribs. &quot;BOOP BEEP!&quot; <br />
  &quot;There we go!&quot; Captain Memory exulted. &quot;Now we've got it!&quot;<br />
  Ernie lay in the dirt, moaning. Captain Memory reached down to<br />
  help him to his feet. &quot;Sorry about that,&quot; he apologized. &quot;Still,<br />
  you have to expect that sort of thing if you're going to go around<br />
  eating remote control units!&quot;<br />
  Ernie staggered to his feet, moaning.<br />
  &quot;Look!&quot; the Fly pointed up into the sky. A bright object<br />
  seemed to be descending in their direction.<br />
  Captain Memory looked at his bare wrist. &quot;Ah, here he comes!<br />
  Right on time!&quot; The Captain looked at his wrist more closely.<br />
  &quot;Well, almost on time.&quot;<br />
  As the bright object approached, Ernie began to make it out<br />
  more clearly. It looked like, well, it looked like an overly-large<br />
  1957 Plymouth taxi. It had huge fins, two-tone paint, and rather a<br />
  lot of rust.<br />
  Captain Memory gestured proudly towards it as it came in for<br />
  a landing. &quot;There it is, guys!&quot; he announced proudly. &quot;The Luna C!<br />
  Ain't she a beauty?&quot;<br />
  Sterno glanced behind them. The sounds of commotion back on<br />
  the trail were increasing. &quot;Not a moment too soon!&quot; he muttered.<br />
  Ernie watched the Luna C as it approached for a landing. He<br />
  noticed that it seemed to be coming in rather fast. With a<br />
  deafening crash, the Luna C slammed into the ground, throwing a<br />
  cloud of dust and dirt in all directions. As the dust settled,<br />
  Ernie noticed a hubcap rolling listlessly away, finally coming to<br />
  a stop by a nearby tree.<br />
  Captain Memory winced, but then quickly regained his<br />
  composure. He started towards the spacecraft. <br />
  The driver's side door of the Luna C opened, and a lanky<br />
  individual with long, unkempt hair got out. He was wearing a loud<br />
  Hawaiian shirt, and dark sunglasses, even though it was night.<br />
  He waved at Captain Memory. &quot;Hey dude, what's happenin'?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Hey, Ralph!&quot; Captain Memory waved cheerily at the driver.<br />
  &quot;This is my pilot, Ralph!&quot; he introduced the man to the group, as<br />
  they all sprinted towards the spacecraft.<br />
  Sterno eyed the Luna C suspiciously. &quot;This is your ship?&quot; <br />
  &quot;That's it!&quot; Captain Memory waved at it proudly.<br />
  &quot;Then how come it says `Taxi' on it?&quot; Sterno asked pointedly.<br />
  Captain Memory's face fell. &quot;Well...well... I was supposed to<br />
  get a limo! Well, they told me I could have a limo, but there was<br />
  this budget problem... Anyway, I could've had a company car, for<br />
  sure, except, um, there was that problem about my license. So,<br />
  anyway...&quot; He trailed off uncomfortably.<br />
  &quot;So you hadda take a cab!&quot; Sterno finished for him.<br />
  &quot;Well... well...&quot; Flustered, Captain Memory broke off. &quot;Yeah.&quot;<br />
  Ernie noticed that the sounds behind them were getting awfully<br />
  close. &quot;Uh, could we talk about this someplace else?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory glanced back down the trail. &quot;You're right!&quot; He<br />
  turned to Ralph. &quot;Let's cruise!&quot;<br />
  Ralph looked uncomfortable. &quot;Uh, I wanted to tell you, dude.<br />
  We got a little problem...&quot;<br />
  &quot;Let's talk about it on the way,&quot; he suggested, glancing back<br />
  down the trail. &quot;The guys around here are, um, uncool!&quot;<br />
  Ralph nodded understandingly. &quot;I can dig it!&quot; He got into the<br />
  driver's seat, while the other four piled into the roomy back seat.<br />
  Ralph shifted into `Fly', and stomped on the accelerator. The<br />
  Luna C instantly shot thirty feet straight up into the air,<br />
  violently flipped upside-down, and hung there, unmoving.<br />
  Ernie, Sterno, and the Fly suddenly found themselves upside-<br />
  down, in a very uncomfortable position, laying halfway on the roof<br />
  and halfway in their seats. Captain Memory and Ralph, however, were<br />
  sitting quite comfortably in their seats as though glued into them.<br />
  &quot;So, like I was saying, dude,&quot; Ralph went on conversationally.<br />
  &quot;We got this little problem...&quot;<br />
  In the position he was in, Ernie could see the ground beneath<br />
  them quite clearly through the Luna C's large rear window. Their<br />
  seemed to be some kind of commotion taking place. The probing<br />
  searchlights and the bobbing torches seemed to have come together.<br />
  Ernie heard shouts, screams, machine-gun fire. Then, all was<br />
  silent. <br />
  After a few moments, the drums and chanting began again. &quot;Oom<br />
  alla boom! Oom alla BOOM!&quot; Ernie could see a fire being lit beneath<br />
  the huge iron pot. It looked as though the Cannibals were going to<br />
  have their feast, after all!<br />
  Ernie's attention returned to the conversation inside the<br />
  space taxi. Ralph was telling his story animatedly. &quot;....so I wired<br />
  the framistatter to the quark generator...&quot; Ralph could see that<br />
  Captain Memory was about to say something, but he cut him off.<br />
  &quot;Yeah, I know you're not supposed to do it. I know, `Warning: Do<br />
  Not Bypass Overload Protection....' Who listens to that crap? So<br />
  anyway, it really kicked up the horsepower, you know what I mean?<br />
  And when the light turned green, man, I was outta there! Those guys<br />
  in the 'Vette, man, they couldn't believe it!  You shoulda seen<br />
  their faces! It was....&quot;<br />
  &quot;So, what happened?&quot; Captain Memory interrupted.<br />
  Ralph became suddenly subdued. &quot;Okay, so maybe the left rear<br />
  antimatter coupler got toasted! It's no biggie! We'll stop at the<br />
  parts store, we'll pick up a new one! It's just a couple bucks! It<br />
  was worth it! You shoulda seen those guys' faces!&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory shook his head sadly. &quot;I got some bad news for<br />
  you, Ralph. The parts store's closed.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, MAN!&quot; Ralph was annoyed. &quot;You mean we're gonna have to<br />
  hang out until the store opens? What a drag!&quot; Ralph shook his head<br />
  unhappily. &quot;So, like, when does it open?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory regarded his wrist carefully. &quot;Let's see, it's<br />
  9:30 right now.... So, I would say, it'll probably open in about,<br />
  oh, two billion years!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, MAN!&quot; Ralph was really upset. &quot;I can't wait two billion<br />
  years! I got a date on Friday!&quot;<br />
  Ernie whimpered. &quot;Does that mean the ship won't fly?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Hey, be cool!&quot; Ralph said comfortingly. &quot;Sure it'll fly! It's<br />
  just a little, uh, handling problem! That's all! Fly's great! Just<br />
  doesn't, uh, handle exactly right!&quot; It was beginning to occur to<br />
  Ralph that perhaps wiring the framisttater to the quark generator<br />
  might not have been such a good idea, after all.<br />
  &quot;Handling problem?&quot; inquired Sterno, and he wriggled about<br />
  trying to find a comfortable position in the upside-down vehicle.<br />
  &quot;Is this part of the `handling problem'?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Hey, it flies fine!&quot; Ralph insisted. &quot;So, maybe it's upside-<br />
  down! I mean...&quot;<br />
  &quot;And sideways!&quot; Captain Memory reminded Ralph.<br />
  &quot;Oh, yeah,&quot; Ralph became quiet. &quot;Sideways. Okay, so it only<br />
  goes upside-down and sideways. Hey, it's no biggie! It gets you<br />
  where you're going, right? Okay, so maybe you wouldn't want to take<br />
  any long trips in it right now, but it get's you.... Uh, well, it<br />
  gets you to the parts store!&quot; he concluded triumphantly.<br />
  &quot;The parts store's closed, Ralph,&quot; Captain Memory reminded him<br />
  gently.<br />
  The Fly's antennae suddenly quivered. &quot;I know!&quot; he said<br />
  excitedly. &quot;How about Road Service? Can you call for a tow?&quot;<br />
  Ralph fidgeted uncomfortably. &quot;Well, um, I sorta been having<br />
  this problem with the towing company... There's this, um, unpaid<br />
  balance....&quot;<br />
  Ernie and the Fly looked at Captain Memory. He shrugged. &quot;Hey,<br />
  I don't got insurance, you know?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory suddenly perked up. &quot;Hey Ralph!&quot; he cried.<br />
  &quot;What about Warp drive?&quot;<br />
  Ralph brightened, and then slowly resumed his glum expression.<br />
  &quot;Uh, well, I don't think you wanna use the Warp drive right now,&quot;<br />
  he shook his head sadly.<br />
  Captain Memory frowned. &quot;Why not?&quot;<br />
  Ralph fidgeted. &quot;Well, it's been kinda acting up a little,&quot; he<br />
  explained. &quot;I been meaning to get something done about it. Just<br />
  yesterday, I said to myself `Ralph, you know you really oughta get<br />
  that warp drive took care of' But, uh, you know, it's like fifty<br />
  credits minimum just to have 'em look at it, and, uh...&quot; He trailed<br />
  off.<br />
  Captain Memory looked confused. &quot;Didn't you get the Repair<br />
  Requisition Voucher from the Main Office?&quot;<br />
  Ralph looked very uncomfortable. &quot;Um, uh, yeah. Well, the<br />
  other night me and the boys was playing a little cards, see, and I<br />
  had this great hand! I had three Galaxies! How could I lose, right?<br />
  But I was all outta chips! All I had left was the Voucher, so I<br />
  said...&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory shook his head sadly. &quot;That's against the<br />
  rules, Ralph!&quot;<br />
  Ralph sighed. &quot;Well, how was I to know the other guy had five<br />
  Nebulae? You know what the odds against that are?&quot;<br />
  Ernie racked his brains for a solution to the problem. &quot;Maybe<br />
  we could just, sort of, give it a try,&quot; he suggested hopefully.<br />
  Ralph sighed. &quot;Well, I thought of that, but last time I tried<br />
  it, I wound up in, um, Dimension 9!&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory was startled. &quot;Dimension 9! Oh, no wonder!&quot; He<br />
  chuckled. &quot;You sure don't wanna wind up in Dimension 9, do you?&quot; <br />
  Ralph nodded his head glumly. &quot;That's for sure!&quot; They all fell<br />
  silent.<br />
  After a few minutes, Ernie heard the sound of snoring. He<br />
  squinted through the near-complete darkness, the only light coming<br />
  from the lights on the dashboard. Ralph seemed to have dropped off<br />
  to sleep. Captain Memory seemed to be nodding as well. Lacking any<br />
  better ideas, Ernie slowly worked himself around to a comfortable<br />
  position, and fell asleep as well.<br />
</p>
<p> CHAPTER 9</p>
<p> It was dawn when Ernie awoke. During the night, the Luna C<br />
  seemed to have drifted quietly to the ground, and was now lying on<br />
  it's top in the dirt. Ernie peered out the windows. The clearing <br />
  was deserted, but signs of last night's revelry remained. The large<br />
  iron pot was tipped over on it's side, empty. Various bones lay<br />
  scattered about. Lying here and there was what appeared to be an<br />
  occasional jackboot. Ernie tried not to look at them.<br />
  After a few moments, the others began to stir. The Fly moaned.<br />
  &quot;Oh man, I hate sleeping in the car! Look at my suit! It's all<br />
  rumpled!&quot; Only Sterno seemed comfortable, curled up in a doglike<br />
  position on the ceiling of the upside-down space taxi.<br />
  Ernie twisted uncomfortably. He was feeling very stiff and<br />
  achy after sleeping in an odd position in the car. Thinking about<br />
  it, his stomach didn't feel very good, either.<br />
  Captain Memory blinked confusedly and looked around. Ralph<br />
  yawned. The Captain looked pointedly at Ralph. &quot;Well,&quot; he said<br />
  unhappily. &quot;I guess there's no getting around it, is there?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, no,&quot; said Ralph dejectedly.<br />
  &quot;You gotta do it,&quot; Captain Memory shook his head despondently.<br />
  &quot;You're gonna have to call the office.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh MAN!&quot; Ralph didn't seem to like this idea at all. &quot;I hate<br />
  calling the office! They always give me a hard time! They'll<br />
  probably leave me on hold forever, too!&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory shook his head sadly. &quot;It's gotta be done,<br />
  Ralph!&quot;<br />
  Ralph sighed. &quot;Oh, okay.&quot; He reached under the seat and pulled<br />
  out what appeared to be a car phone. He picked up the handset and<br />
  dialed, looking very glum.<br />
  &quot;Hi Stella, it's Ralph.&quot; Ernie could only hear Ralph's side of<br />
  the conversation. Ralph seemed upset. &quot;Look Stella, don't start up<br />
  with me, okay? I'm having a bad day, okay? Look, it wasn't my<br />
  fault! Anyway, I gotta talk to the boss, is he... Oh no, Stella,<br />
  don't put me on...&quot; Suddenly, Ralph froze into immobility. Ernie<br />
  peered at him. Ralph was absolutely motionless, like a statue. He<br />
  didn't even seem to be breathing.<br />
  Ernie turned to Captain Memory. &quot;What happened to Ralph?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory seemed unconcerned. &quot;Oh, they put him on<br />
  `hold'.&quot;<br />
  &quot;On `Hold'?&quot; Ernie was uncomprehending.<br />
  Captain Memory shrugged. &quot;Well, you know, they always do that<br />
  when you want to talk to the boss. You can't expect him to drop<br />
  everything just to talk to YOU, can you?&quot; The Captain chuckled at<br />
  the thought.<br />
  Ernie peered at Ralph. &quot;He's not breathing!&quot;<br />
  &quot;No, he doesn't need to. He's in suspended animation,&quot; the<br />
  Captain explained, yawning and stretching. &quot;That way, you're not<br />
  aware of how much time has passed while you're waiting for your<br />
  connection!&quot;<br />
  Ernie frowned. &quot;I don't think I'd like that.&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory shrugged. &quot;I guess they feel it's kinder that<br />
  way,&quot; he conjectured.<br />
  &quot;`Kinder?'&quot; Ernie was having a hard time with all of this.<br />
  &quot;It's either that or Muzak,&quot; Sterno explained.<br />
  &quot;Oh.&quot; Ernie considered this. &quot;Yeah, I guess suspended<br />
  animation would be better!&quot; He looked over at Ralph. &quot;So, how long<br />
  is he gonna be like that?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Let me see...&quot; Captain Memory examined his bare wrist<br />
  closely. &quot;It's ten o'clock now, so I'd say, oh, about two billion<br />
  years.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Two billion years!&quot; Ernie was aghast.<br />
  &quot;Look at the bright side,&quot; Captain Memory went on cheerfully.<br />
  &quot;By then, the parts store will be open!&quot;<br />
  Ernie moaned. &quot;What are we supposed to do in the meantime?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory frowned. &quot;Good point! We can't very well sit<br />
  around here, can we?&quot; He chuckled. &quot;Might as well hit the road!&quot; He<br />
  opened the car door, and flipped himself neatly around from his<br />
  current sitting position, which was, of course, upside-down<br />
  relative to the others, and landed neatly on his feet on the ground<br />
  outside. He turned to Ernie. &quot;Coming?&quot;<br />
  Ernie crawled painfully out through the open car door, and<br />
  struggled to his feet on the ground outside. <br />
  The group assembled themselves outside the upside-down taxi,<br />
  all of them stretching and yawning. Ernie peered into the interior<br />
  of the taxi until he spotted his coffee maker, which he carefully<br />
  retrieved. He stood up beside the taxi, and looked about<br />
  confusedly. <br />
  Sterno seemed to have regained his composure more quickly than<br />
  the other members of the group. &quot;What is this `Office' that you and<br />
  Ralph were talking about?&quot; he asked Captain Memory pointedly.<br />
  The Captain looked suddenly uncomfortable. &quot;Well, uh, you<br />
  know, everybody's got to work for a living...&quot; He trailed off.<br />
  &quot;You mean you're not a full-time Super Hero?&quot; the Fly<br />
  inquired. He seemed disappointed.<br />
  Captain Memory shuffled awkwardly. &quot;Well, uh, you know, Super<br />
  Hero-ing doesn't pay too good...&quot;<br />
  &quot;What exactly do you do at this `Office'?&quot; Ernie wanted to<br />
  know.<br />
  &quot;Oh, you know, a little programming...&quot; The Captain seemed<br />
  evasive.<br />
  &quot;Oh,&quot; said Sterno with relish. &quot;This is beginning to make a<br />
  lot more sense to me now! THAT'S how you manage to do all these<br />
  tricky things here in Cyberspace! You're using the Company<br />
  computer! You've got a mainframe to work with, don't you?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well...&quot; Captain Memory seemed very uncomfortable.<br />
  Sterno continued. &quot;I bet you're not running all this from a<br />
  PC!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well, no,&quot; the Captain admitted. &quot;I got a Cray.&quot;<br />
  &quot;A CRAY!?&quot; Even Ernie, who knew very little about computers,<br />
  had heard of the awesome power of a Cray.<br />
  &quot;Well, it's not mine, personally, you understand,&quot; the Captain<br />
  began defensively.<br />
  &quot;In other words,&quot; Sterno said reflectively. &quot;You're using the<br />
  Company's Cray to break into Waldo Stadium's stolen systems and<br />
  free the Cyberslaves.&quot; Sterno's eyes narrowed. &quot;Aren't you supposed<br />
  to be doing something more productive?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Hey, this is important!&quot; Captain Memory insisted indignantly.<br />
  &quot;Anyway, it's part of R &amp; D, you know? After all, I could....&quot;<br />
  He was suddenly interrupted by the thunderous BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! of<br />
  jungle drums. A distant chanting reached their ears. Ernie<br />
  struggled to make it out. It seemed to be something like &quot;Oom alla<br />
  boom, YUM YUM YUM!&quot; <br />
  &quot;Maybe we should, um, get moving?&quot; Ernie suggested. <br />
  &quot;Uh, sure!&quot; The Captain agreed, glad to change the subject.<br />
  &quot;Let's go!&quot; He began striding purposefully forward. He walked right<br />
  up to an impenetrable thicket, and stopped, looking at it<br />
  confusedly.<br />
  &quot;How about this trail?&quot; Ernie suggested, pointing to a narrow<br />
  path that led through the underbrush in the opposite direction from<br />
  the trail they had come in on. It was also, luckily, leading the<br />
  opposite direction from the jungle drums.<br />
  Captain Memory snapped his fingers. &quot;Of course! That's it! A<br />
  trail! We need a trail! Now, why didn't I think of that?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Good question,&quot; Sterno agreed.<br />
  Captain Memory headed purposefully down the trail; the others<br />
  following behind him.<br />
  Within seconds the forest seemed to close in around them.<br />
  Ernie could see nothing around him but dense underbrush. All he<br />
  could see ahead of him was Captain Memory's back. He supposed that<br />
  he didn't have much alternative except to just keep moving along<br />
  the trail. At least the sound of the jungle drums was diminishing.<br />
  Ernie began to be aware of a sound in the distance. A sort of<br />
  whooshing sound. It sounded almost like distant traffic noises. He<br />
  considered it. It was probably just the wind in the trees, he<br />
  decided.<br />
  Captain Memory stopped abruptly, causing Ernie to just about<br />
  pile into his back. &quot;Hmm,&quot; he said, peering intently forward.<br />
  &quot;You can get through that opening right there,&quot; the Fly's<br />
  voice came from behind. As usual, his hyper-acute vision had<br />
  spotted details which everyone else missed. <br />
  Captain Memory pushed through a narrow gap in the bushes. The<br />
  others followed.<br />
  Pushing through the dense brush Ernie emerged on to.... a<br />
  clearing? No, it was a lawn. A big mowed lawn. About fifty yards<br />
  ahead was a large parking lot, followed by a huge chrome-and-glass<br />
  office building. In the distance was what appeared to be a major<br />
  highway, from which Ernie could hear what were, indeed, traffic<br />
  sounds.<br />
  &quot;HEY!&quot; A gruff voice interrupted them.<br />
  &quot;Huh?&quot; Ernie looked around confusedly.<br />
  &quot;Get outta da flower bed!&quot; Ernie looked down. He was standing<br />
  on top of a dozen beautiful, but crushed, tulips.<br />
  &quot;NOW!&quot; the voice demanded. Ernie rushed forward onto the<br />
  grass, destroying dozens more beautiful flowers in the process.<br />
  Ernie looked back to see the rest of the group carefully picking<br />
  their way forward through the flowers, careful not to cause any<br />
  more damage.<br />
  Ernie looked up to see the owner of the gruff voice<br />
  approaching. He was a short, heavy-set man in coveralls, smoking a<br />
  cigar. He appeared to be the groundskeeper.<br />
  He glanced at the group, and singled out Ernie. &quot;Look whatcha<br />
  did to my flowers! Whatsa matter with you kids, anyway? You wanna<br />
  use the Park, you follow the rules! You stay on the trail, you<br />
  don't go walking through the flower beds!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Park?&quot; Ernie was uncomprehending.<br />
  &quot;Poodawumpus Park!&quot; the gardener repeated insistently. &quot;What<br />
  you just came outta! You stay on the trail, you follow the signs,<br />
  you don't be tearin' up the bushes!&quot; He glared at the entire group.<br />
  &quot;Um, we didn't see any signs,&quot; the Fly said carefully.<br />
  &quot;Aaah, the damn kids tore up the signs again! Little brats!<br />
  I'll kill 'em!&quot; The groundskeeper chomped his cigar angrily.<br />
  &quot;Um, there were these natives...&quot; Ernie began uncertainly.<br />
  &quot;Yeah, o' course there's natives! It's a nature park! There's<br />
  natural natives in it!&quot; He looked at Ernie suspiciously. &quot;You<br />
  didn't feed the natives, didja?&quot;<br />
  &quot;No, no!&quot; Ernie protested. &quot;We didn't even get near 'em!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Good!&quot; The groundskeeper seemed slightly placated. &quot;They eat<br />
  what's not on their diet, it makes 'em sick!&quot; He continued to<br />
  regard the group suspiciously. &quot;You didn't leave no junk in there,<br />
  didja? Damn kids party in there on weekends, leave the trail fulla<br />
  junk! I once hadda haul a whole junk car outta there!&quot; He glared<br />
  accusingly at the foursome.<br />
  &quot;No, no,&quot; Ernie protested. &quot;We're real neat. We never litter!&quot;<br />
  &quot;We don't allow no dogs on the trail, neither!&quot; He glared at<br />
  Sterno. &quot;Sign says so, right at da entrance!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Um, we didn't see...&quot; the Fly began.<br />
  &quot;Yeah, yeah, I know. Damn kids stole da sign! Awright, I'll<br />
  letcha off dis time, but next time I swear I'm gonna calla cops!&quot;<br />
  &quot;We're real sorry!&quot; Ernie began edging away. &quot;It won't happen<br />
  again!&quot; The group started moving slowly in the direction of the<br />
  office building.<br />
  &quot;Yeah, yeah,&quot; the groundskeeper was looking ruefully at his<br />
  crushed flowers.<br />
  The Fly shook his head. &quot;Boy, is he gonna be mad when he finds<br />
  the Luna...&quot;<br />
  &quot;Sssh!&quot; Sterno warned.<br />
  &quot;What?!&quot; the groundskeeper turned back to them.<br />
  &quot;Uh, have a nice day!&quot; Ernie said quickly. &quot;Good-bye!&quot; He<br />
  waved cheerfully, and started walking quickly towards the office<br />
  building. The others followed.<br />
  Ernie was confused. &quot;Why is there an office building here?&quot; he<br />
  asked Captain Memory.<br />
  The Captain thought about it for a moment. &quot;Looks like it's<br />
  somebody's architecture program.&quot;<br />
  &quot;I've heard of that,&quot; Sterno commented. &quot;The architects model<br />
  a building in Virtual Reality, so that the clients can see if they<br />
  like it or not before it's actually built.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well, we might as well take a look at their handiwork,&quot; the<br />
  Captain decided.<br />
  The continued over the large parking lot that lay in front of<br />
  them. It was almost empty; only an occasional car was parked here<br />
  and there. They soon reached the doors of the building and entered.<br />
  In front of them lay a small, utilitarian lobby, typical of<br />
  cheaply-constructed office buildings. In the center of the lobby<br />
  was a booth marked &quot;Information&quot;, but there was no-one manning it.<br />
  Most of the offices appeared to be closed.<br />
  On the wall was a directory to the offices in the building,<br />
  which the Fly was reading carefully. &quot;Mostly lawyers,&quot; he said<br />
  ruefully.<br />
  &quot;We may need a lawyer after all the damage HE's caused,&quot;<br />
  Sterno said, looking at Ernie accusingly.<br />
  &quot;Me!&quot; Ernie protested.<br />
  &quot;Oh, look!&quot; the Fly broke in. &quot;There's an office that's open!&quot;<br />
  He pointed down a long corridor.<br />
  &quot;Great!&quot; Ernie enthused, glad for an opportunity to change the<br />
  subject. &quot;Maybe we can go in and ask...&quot; He stopped, and looked at<br />
  Captain Memory expectantly. &quot;Uh, what should we ask them?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Good idea!&quot; Captain Memory agreed, although Ernie wasn't<br />
  exactly sure what it was that the Captain was agreeing with. The<br />
  Captain started off briskly down the hall, in the direction of the<br />
  open office. The other three followed behind him.<br />
  &quot;Ah, good, you're here! We've been expecting you!&quot; An<br />
  efficient-looking receptionist in a crisp white uniform greeted<br />
  them cheerfully.<br />
  &quot;See?&quot; the Fly pointed out brightly. &quot;They've been expecting<br />
  us! Therefore, we must be in the right place!&quot; The Fly was quite<br />
  pleased with this leap of logic.<br />
  Ernie looked around. They were in a large waiting room,<br />
  decorated in doctor's office green. The room was filled with rows<br />
  of chairs, and an occasional table, on which there lay heaps of<br />
  very old magazines. In the background some easy-listening music was<br />
  playing quietly. There was, as usual, no-one else there. Ernie<br />
  moaned. &quot;Oh, man! Why would they be expecting us? We're not even<br />
  supposed to be here! What's going ON!?&quot;<br />
  The Fly shook his head. &quot;I dunno, man, sometimes you can be<br />
  just, such a downer! Why don't you like, lighten up a little?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Obviously,&quot; sniffed Sterno. &quot;We must be in the right place,<br />
  because they are, after all, expecting us! How could they be<br />
  expecting us if we weren't in the right place?&quot;<br />
  &quot;But...&quot; Ernie began. The receptionist interrupted.<br />
  &quot;The doctor will see you now.&quot; She opened a door to another<br />
  room.<br />
  &quot;Oh, good!&quot; The Fly was pleased. &quot;You know, I've been having<br />
  this pain in my neck...&quot;  He began rubbing it vigorously. &quot;Maybe he<br />
  can give me something for it!&quot; He strode purposefully through the<br />
  door.<br />
  Ernie shuffled uncomfortably. &quot;I hate going to the doctor!&quot; <br />
  &quot;Oh, come ON!&quot; Sterno stood impatiently behind Ernie. &quot;Don't<br />
  be such a baby about it!&quot;<br />
  Ernie sighed, and followed the Fly, accompanied by Sterno and<br />
  Captain Memory.<br />
  They found themselves in a large room, with a dozen chairs set<br />
  in a circle. A few of the chairs were occupied. In one, a fat blond<br />
  woman sat, nervously munching something from a bag on her lap. Two<br />
  chairs to the left sat a very depressed looking young man, wringing<br />
  his hands constantly and moaning quietly. He looked steadfastly at<br />
  the floor, never looking up. A little further on sat a dishevelled,<br />
  wild-eyed man who kept constantly lighting matches. Every time one<br />
  lit, he would laugh hysterically.<br />
  Against one wall was a chair that was larger than the others.<br />
  In it sat an older man in an old fashioned, black suit. He was<br />
  bald, with a goatee beard, and smoked a cigar. He carried a<br />
  notepad, and seemed to be taking notes on everything that was<br />
  happening. He looked up.<br />
  &quot;Ah, gut!&quot; He smiled at the foursome. &quot;You are chust in time<br />
  for ze group therapy session! Please, sit down.&quot; He gestured<br />
  towards the empty chairs on the opposite side of the room from the<br />
  other patients. The foursome sat down. Ernie carefully placed the<br />
  coffee maker by his side.<br />
  &quot;Oh, you must be the doctor!&quot; The Fly observed. He looked<br />
  around confusedly. &quot;But, what kind of doctor are you?&quot;<br />
  &quot;A psychiatrist, of course!&quot; The doctor replied. &quot;You have<br />
  been having, hmm, some problems in regard to your appearance, ja?&quot;<br />
  &quot;That's right!&quot; The Fly was amazed. He turned to the others.<br />
  &quot;I wonder how he knew that?&quot;<br />
  Sterno looked at the doctor's cigar excitedly. &quot;I say, you<br />
  wouldn't happen to have an extra cigar, would you?&quot; The<br />
  psychiatrist produced one from an inner pocket of his jacket. <br />
  &quot;Thanks ever so much!&quot; Sterno lit the cigar, and puffed<br />
  contentedly.<br />
  Ernie was suspicious. &quot;You've got a German accent!&quot; he said<br />
  accusingly.<br />
  The psychiatrist drew himself up, looking very offended.<br />
  &quot;Dat's an AUSTRIAN accent!&quot; he sniffed. &quot;I have studied in Vienna<br />
  with ze great Dr. Freud himself!&quot; He peered closely at Ernie. &quot;Zo,<br />
  you have zis feeling zat you are being persecuted, ja? Zat everyone<br />
  is against you?&quot;<br />
  Ernie was taken aback. &quot;Well, um, now that you mention it,<br />
  yeah!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Chust as ve thought!&quot; the psychiatrist said, scribbling<br />
  something on his notepad. &quot;Classic paranoia!&quot;<br />
  Ernie was about to protest, when suddenly the door opened, and<br />
  two more patients entered. Ernie looked up, and then moaned. It was<br />
  Lucy and Desi.<br />
  &quot;Hi, guys!&quot; Lucy waved brightly to the foursome.<br />
  &quot;Chick-a-BOOM!&quot; agreed Desi. He seemed to have acquired a new<br />
  Cuban shirt, and another pair of maracas. They sat down on the<br />
  unoccupied chairs across from the psychiatrist.<br />
  &quot;Gut!&quot; exclaimed the doctor. &quot;Now ve are all here; ve can<br />
  begin!&quot; He turned to Lucy. &quot;Now, Lucy, last veek you vere telling<br />
  us about your problem...&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, doctor!&quot; Lucy exclaimed. &quot;It's all those TV shows from<br />
  Earth! They're driving me crazy!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Ach, zo!&quot; The psychiatrist exclaimed quietly. &quot;Und, vhy is<br />
  dat?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, doctor!&quot; Lucy exclaimed again. &quot;Every time we turn on our<br />
  Vidicom sets on my home planet, all we get is old TV shows from<br />
  Earth! Our sets are very sensitive, and your signals keep drowning<br />
  ours out!&quot;<br />
  &quot;I zee,&quot; said the doctor thoughtfully. &quot;Und you find<br />
  zis...upsetting?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, doctor!&quot; cried Lucy again. &quot;We're not humans! We're<br />
  reptiles! We don't wanna watch Earth TV shows! They're all about<br />
  mammals! `Lassie!' `My Friend Flicka!' `Leave it to Beaver!'<br />
  They're all MAMMALS! We want to watch our OWN TV shows! About<br />
  REPTILES!&quot; She seemed very upset.<br />
  &quot;Ach zo,&quot; the doctor nodded. &quot;Und you think dat if you conquer<br />
  ze Earth, you vould feel better, ja?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh doctor!&quot; Lucy seemed very agitated. &quot;Don't you see? We've<br />
  got to do something to stop those TV signals! We just can't stand<br />
  it anymore! They're driving us CRAZY!&quot;<br />
  The doctor nodded thoughtfully, scribbling notes on his pad.<br />
  He thought for a moment. &quot;But, you are 40 light years from here, so<br />
  you are just now receiving signals from 40 years ago, ja?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Yes?&quot; Lucy agreed tentatively.<br />
  &quot;Zo,&quot; the psychiatrist continued thoughtfully. &quot;Even if you<br />
  stop ze signals today, you vill continue to receive ze signals zat<br />
  have already been sent. You vill continue to receive ze Earth TV<br />
  shows...&quot; He paused expectantly. &quot;...for ze NEXT 40 YEARS!&quot;<br />
  &quot;NO!&quot; Lucy screamed. She buried her face in her arms, sobbing<br />
  hysterically. &quot;I can't stand it! I just can't stand it!&quot; She<br />
  continued to sob uncontrollably. Ricky patted her back. &quot;Chick-a-<br />
  BOOM!&quot; he said commiseratingly.<br />
  The Fly's eyes clouded sympathetically. &quot;Aw, gee!&quot; His<br />
  antennae waved in consternation. &quot;I hate to see a woman cry!&quot;<br />
  Sterno nodded sagely. &quot;I suppose I can see her point.&quot; He<br />
  thought for a moment. &quot;I've always rather enjoyed `Lassie',<br />
  though.&quot;<br />
  A thought popped into Ernie's head. &quot;What about `Rin-Tin-<br />
  Tin'?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Not bad,&quot; Sterno agreed thoughtfully, puffing on his cigar.<br />
  He looked almost like a canine version of the psychiatrist. &quot;And<br />
  then there's `Sgt. Preston of the Yukon'. It wouldn't be a bad<br />
  show, if only King could get rid of that silly fellow in the red<br />
  suit!&quot;<br />
  &quot;MAMMALS!&quot; Lucy screamed, sobbing with renewed intensity.<br />
  The psychiatrist stroked his beard thoughtfully. &quot;Zere is,<br />
  perhaps, a solution!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Yes?&quot; Lucy looked up expectantly, her makeup streaked by<br />
  tears. It seemed to Ernie that he could see a hint of something<br />
  green beneath it.<br />
  &quot;Perhaps... ze time machine!&quot; the doctor seemed deep in<br />
  thought. <br />
  Ernie turned to Captain Memory in confusion. &quot;Time machine?&quot;<br />
  he whispered.<br />
  &quot;It isn't a real time machine,&quot; the Captain explained. It's a<br />
  Virtual time machine. You aren't actually travelling through time,<br />
  but you might as well be. Like when we went back to four billion<br />
  B.C.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh.&quot; Ernie was not exactly following this, but he noticed the<br />
  others glaring at him, so he decided to stop.<br />
  The psychiatrist continued. &quot;Perhaps, you could go back in<br />
  time, back 40 years, und stop zese signals before zey start?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh doctor!&quot; Lucy cried hopefully. &quot;Do you really think it<br />
  would work?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Stop TV!?&quot; cried the Fly, obviously very upset at the<br />
  thought. &quot;Oh, no! How could we survive without TV!? It would be the<br />
  end of... of...&quot; The Fly tried hard to think what it would be the<br />
  end of. &quot;Of civilization AS WE KNOW IT!&quot; he cried triumphantly.<br />
  &quot;True,&quot; the psychiatrist agreed pensively. Lucy's eyes began<br />
  to fill with tears.<br />
  &quot;But, perhaps...&quot; the doctor continued slowly. Lucy peered at<br />
  him expectantly.<br />
  The psychiatrist went on. &quot;Perhaps it would not be stopped,<br />
  but chust changed a little. So dot it vould not be a bother to ze<br />
  space creatures!&quot;<br />
  Lucy sat up excitedly. &quot;Oh, yes! Yes!&quot; She turned to Ricky.<br />
  &quot;Oh, Ricky! We could do it! I know we could do it! If only we had<br />
  a time machine!&quot;<br />
  The psychiatrist smiled. &quot;Vell, as a matter of fact, I chust<br />
  happen to have one right here...&quot; He gestured towards a door that<br />
  Ernie had assumed was a closet.<br />
  Ernie was, once again, suspicious. &quot;What would a psychiatrist<br />
  be doing with a time machine?&quot; he wanted to know.<br />
  &quot;Oh, it is chust ze thing for ze childhood trauma,&quot; the doctor<br />
  explained. &quot;You go back in time, prevent ze traumatic incident, und<br />
  ze patient is cured!&quot;<br />
  Ernie had to admit that this did, in fact, sound reasonable.<br />
  The psychiatrist peered intently at Ernie. &quot;Vhen did you first<br />
  notice dat you felt suspicious of everyone?&quot;<br />
  Ernie was somewhat taken aback by this sudden change in<br />
  questioning. &quot;Um, actually,&quot; he though about it. &quot;It started when<br />
  I first went into the Virtual Arcade...&quot;<br />
  &quot;Bye, guys!&quot; Lucy interrupted. She and Ricky were standing at<br />
  the door of the closet, or time machine, or whatever it was. &quot;We're<br />
  going into the past now, so we probably won't be seeing you<br />
  anymore!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Take it easy!&quot; cried the Fly cheerfully. He was relieved that<br />
  Lucy had stopped crying.<br />
  &quot;Um...&quot; A thought occurred to Ernie. &quot;Does that mean that<br />
  you're not going to needing my brain, after all?&quot;<br />
  Lucy's brow furled thoughtfully. She looked at Ricky. He<br />
  shrugged. &quot;No, I guess you might as well just keep it.&quot; Ernie<br />
  sighed in relief. Lucy continued, &quot;If it turns out we need it after<br />
  all, we'll get back to you, okay?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Uh, yeah...&quot; Ernie fidgeted uncomfortably. He had hoped that<br />
  the problem would go away completely, but that seemed to be too<br />
  much to expect. At least he didn't have to worry about it right<br />
  now!<br />
  Lucy opened the door to the time machine. She waved at the<br />
  foursome. &quot;See you...uh...later? Uh, earlier?&quot; She looked confused.<br />
  She turned to Ricky. &quot;Bye!&quot; he said, and ushered Lucy into the<br />
  machine. The door closed behind them.<br />
  Captain Memory yawned. He was finding this all rather boring.<br />
  &quot;I wonder what's on TV?&quot; he mused, pulling out the TV guide. A look<br />
  of concern came over his face.<br />
  Ernie noticed this. &quot;What's the matter?&quot;<br />
  &quot;It's the programs,&quot; the Captain said, looking distressed.<br />
  &quot;They've, um, changed!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Changed?&quot; Ernie was uncomprehending. &quot;Changed how?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well, for instance,&quot; the Captain explained. &quot;Instead of `I<br />
  Love Lucy', there's now `I Wanna Donna', starring Donna the Iguana,<br />
  and her husband Ricky the Reptile. In fact,&quot; Captain Memory flipped<br />
  through the pages quickly. &quot;They all seem to be Reptile shows!&quot;<br />
  Ernie buried his face in his hands. &quot;Oh, no! Now, instead of<br />
  them having to watch our shows, we have to watch THEIR shows!&quot;<br />
  Cm continued calmly perusing the TV Guide. &quot;Aside from that,<br />
  they're pretty much the same. The plots seem to be about the same.&quot;<br />
  He chuckled. &quot;Oh, look! Here's the episode where Ricky Jr.<br />
  hatches!&quot;<br />
  Sterno seemed lost in thought. &quot;That reptile lady's name<br />
  wasn't really Lucy, was it?&quot; he asked the psychiatrist. <br />
  &quot;Oh, no,&quot; agreed the doctor. &quot;Dat's only her stage name!&quot;<br />
  Sterno's eyes narrowed. &quot;Her real name wouldn't, by any<br />
  chance, happen to be....&quot; He paused for effect. &quot;...DONNA, would<br />
  it?&quot; He watched the psychiatrist closely.<br />
  The doctor fidgeted uncomfortably. &quot;Uh, I'm, um, not allowed<br />
  to divulge personal information about....&quot;<br />
  Sterno cut him off. &quot;Just as we thought!&quot;  Sterno puffed his<br />
  cigar contemplatively. &quot;You know, some people will do anything to<br />
  get into show biz!&quot;<br />
  The Fly's antennae waved worriedly. &quot;I don't know if I'm going<br />
  to like watching Reptile shows all the time!&quot;<br />
  The psychiatrist regained his composure. &quot;Vith every<br />
  successful therapy, there is always a period of readjustment for ze<br />
  family. In time, you vill learn to deal vith dis new situation.&quot;<br />
  He turned to Captain Memory. &quot;Und you must be ze one vis ze<br />
  amnesia problem!&quot;<br />
  The Captain looked up. &quot;Who, me?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Dat's right!&quot; the psychiatrist looked at him intently. &quot;You<br />
  have ze amnesia, ja?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory looked confused. &quot;Not that I recall!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Chust as ve thought!&quot; the doctor said triumphantly,<br />
  scribbling furiously on his notepad.<br />
  All of this was making Ernie very uncomfortable. &quot;Hey guys,&quot;<br />
  he whispered to the others. &quot;I think maybe we ought to get going!&quot;<br />
  &quot;What IS your problem?&quot; said Sterno loudly.<br />
  &quot;Um, uh...&quot; Everyone was looking at Ernie. He didn't know what<br />
  to say.<br />
  The Fly looked puzzled. &quot;Is something the matter?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, don't pay any attention to him,&quot; scoffed Sterno,<br />
  gesturing in Ernie's direction. &quot;He's just paranoid!&quot;<br />
  &quot;I am not!&quot; said Ernie defensively.<br />
  The Fly seemed confused. &quot;Paranoids never admit they're<br />
  paranoid,&quot; explained Sterno.<br />
  &quot;Please, please, gentlemen,&quot; the psychiatrist broke in. &quot;Ve<br />
  must return to ze topic. Everyone vill get his turn to speak.&quot; He<br />
  tuned to Ernie reassuringly. &quot;Ve must not allow our paranoia to<br />
  carry us away, ja?&quot; He smiled. It seemed to Ernie that the smile<br />
  wasn't very friendly. But then, he thought, that's what a paranoid<br />
  would think! Could it be that the doctor was right, and that he,<br />
  Ernie, had become paranoid? Ernie didn't know what to think any<br />
  more!<br />
  &quot;Zo,&quot; the doctor turned again to Captain Memory. &quot;You vere<br />
  telling us about your computer hacking activities, ja?&quot;<br />
  &quot;I was?&quot; The Captain looked puzzled. &quot;I don't recall that!&quot;<br />
  Ernie's eyes narrowed. He didn't recall that, either!<br />
  &quot;Ja, ja,&quot; the psychiatrist said reassuringly. &quot;Amnesia is a<br />
  terrible thing! Ve must begin your therapy right avay!&quot; He pulled<br />
  out a gold pocket watch on the end of a long chain, and began<br />
  swinging it slowly back and forth in front of Captain Memory.<br />
  &quot;Vatch de vatch,&quot; he whispered to the Captain. &quot;Now, go back,<br />
  back....Vhat do you remember?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory seemed to be completely hypnotized.<br />
  &quot;It's...it's so confusing! Images, numbers, it's space...yes,<br />
  Cyberspace! And it's all filled with strange images! Games,<br />
  pictures, old movies and TV shows! They're all coming at me! All at<br />
  the same time! They're filling my head! They're taking over my<br />
  brain!!&quot; The Captain was becoming very agitated.<br />
  &quot;Relax, calm yourself,&quot; the psychiatrist whispered. The<br />
  Captain seemed calmer now. &quot;Go back, further back. Vhat do you<br />
  see?&quot;<br />
  The Captain seemed to be in a daze. &quot;Pyramids...Pharaohs...&quot;<br />
  &quot;No, no,&quot; the psychiatrist protested. &quot;Not THAT far back!&quot;<br />
  &quot;I knew it!&quot; Ernie broke in. &quot;Ancient Egypt!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Please!&quot; the doctor snapped, glaring at Ernie. &quot;Do not<br />
  interrupt! Your time.... vill come!&quot; He smiled evilly. Or, on the<br />
  other hand, perhaps Ernie only imagined that he smiled evilly?<br />
  Maybe he was really trying to help, and Ernie's paranoia was making<br />
  him imagine something else? Ernie just didn't know anymore!<br />
  &quot;I remember... breaking out of an egg...&quot; The Fly was talking<br />
  now. He, too, seemed to be in a daze. <br />
  Oh, wow! thought Ernie. The Fly must have been watching while<br />
  the doctor hypnotized Captain Memory! Now he's hypnotized, too!<br />
  The psychiatrist glared at the Fly. &quot;Quiet, please!&quot;<br />
  The Fly paid no attention. He kept on talking. &quot;A larva!<br />
  That's it! I'm a larva...&quot;<br />
  The doctor attempted to coax more from Captain Memory. &quot;Now,<br />
  go back...&quot; <br />
  The Fly broke in again. &quot;I'm a larva, and I'm on a nice, warm<br />
  pile of garbage! Yes...&quot;<br />
  The psychiatrist cursed under his breath. He turned to the<br />
  Fly. &quot;Wake up!&quot; He snapped his fingers in front of the Fly's face.<br />
  Both the Fly and Captain Memory awoke instantly. The Fly put<br />
  his hands up to his head. &quot;Oh wow!&quot; he said uncertainly. &quot;I must<br />
  have dozed off!&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory yawned. &quot;That's funny! So did I! And I've been<br />
  having the strangest dreams!&quot;<br />
  The doctor turned to Captain Memory with keen interest. &quot;Zo,<br />
  tell me about zese dreams!&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory scratched his head. &quot;Well, I was in Ancient<br />
  Egypt, and I....&quot; He trailed off.<br />
  &quot;Please, go on!&quot; the psychiatrist urged.<br />
  The Captain looked confused. &quot;That's all I can remember!&quot;<br />
  The doctor cursed again. He suddenly became aware that Ernie<br />
  was watching him. He cleared his throat, and regained his<br />
  composure.<br />
  &quot;Zo,&quot; he began. &quot;Now, ve give ze other patients a turn.&quot;<br />
  The doctor turned to one of the patients that had been in the<br />
  room when the foursome arrived: the depressed-looking man who kept<br />
  wringing his hands. &quot;Why don't you tell us your name, and vhat has<br />
  brought you to see us today?&quot;<br />
  The other patient looked somehow familiar to Ernie. &quot;Vell,<br />
  doctor, my name is Holger Horses. Und mein problem, vell, it's mein<br />
  job!&quot; He continued to look steadfastly at the floor, never once<br />
  looking up at the others around him.<br />
  Ernie thought it was very odd that this patient, too, had a<br />
  German accent. But then, on the other hand, perhaps he was just<br />
  being paranoid.<br />
  The patient went on. &quot;Mein boss, he is so...demanding. If I<br />
  make even one liddle mistake, he hits me vith his riding crop! Und<br />
  if I don't make any mistake, he hits me anyway!&quot; He sniffled. He<br />
  seemed about to cry. &quot;It makes me feel so....inadequate!&quot;<br />
  &quot;There, there,&quot; said the doctor commiseratingly, handing the<br />
  man a handkerchief.<br />
  The man blew his nose noisily. &quot;I mean, it's not mein fault<br />
  dat they keep getting avay! Ve lock them up good! But somehow, dey<br />
  get out, and I get blamed!&quot; He sniffled. &quot;Vhy do dey keep doing dis<br />
  to me? All ve vant to do is torture dem a liddle!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, ja, ja,&quot; the psychiatrist said compassionately. &quot;Ze<br />
  vorkplace is so demanding dese days! I understand exactly how you<br />
  feel!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Do you, doctor?&quot; The man looked up hopefully, pleadingly, at<br />
  the psychiatrist. &quot;Does dat mean you von't hit me vith the riding<br />
  crop any more?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Dummkopf!&quot; the psychiatrist hissed. The man caught his breath<br />
  suddenly, and looked quickly back down at the floor. He began to<br />
  moan quietly again.<br />
  The doctor laughed nervously. &quot;Vell, uh, perhaps ve had best<br />
  go on to ze next patient!&quot; He turned to the other man, the one who<br />
  continuously lit matches. &quot;Und your name, sir?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Vell, Herr Doktor, mein name ist Horst Manure,&quot; the man<br />
  continued to light matches as he talked.<br />
  It seemed very odd to Ernie that this patient, too, spoke with<br />
  a German accent. <br />
  &quot;I zee,&quot; said the psychiatrist. &quot;Und vhen did you first notice<br />
  zis fascination vith...fire?&quot;<br />
  The patient giggled. &quot;Vell, it shtarted vhen Rome burned.<br />
  Flames, everywhere. The whole city in flames. People running,<br />
  screaming. It was chust...SO much fun!&quot; He stared fixedly as the<br />
  match slowly burned down to his fingertips. <br />
  Ernie couldn't help interrupting. &quot;Wait a minute! How could<br />
  you be old enough to be in Rome when it burned?&quot;<br />
  The patient looked taken aback. He looked quickly at the<br />
  doctor. The doctor seemed very uncomfortable. &quot;Uh, um...ze time<br />
  machine! Oh yes, he use ze time machine!&quot;<br />
  &quot;What's he doing with a time machine, anyway?&quot; Ernie demanded.<br />
  The psychiatrist quickly regained his poise. He peered at<br />
  Ernie. &quot;Zo, do you haff zese attacks of paranoia often?&quot;<br />
  Ernie was caught off guard. &quot;Um...uh...yes! Uh, I mean, NO!&quot;<br />
  He was becoming very confused.<br />
  The psychiatrist nodded knowingly. &quot;I zee!&quot;<br />
  Ernie pouted. &quot;I think there's something pretty suspicious<br />
  about this whole business!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Of course you do,&quot; Sterno puffed contentedly on his cigar.<br />
  &quot;You're paranoid!&quot;<br />
  &quot;No, I'm....&quot; Ernie began.<br />
  Sterno continued, cutting Ernie off. &quot;You know, I've always<br />
  suspected as much. But, now that we have the doctor's diagnosis, we<br />
  know for sure!&quot;<br />
  Something occurred to Ernie. &quot;You `suspected' as much?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Yes, all along,&quot; Sterno maintained smugly.<br />
  &quot;Well, if you're `suspecting' things, than maybe YOU'RE the<br />
  paranoid!&quot; Ernie cried out triumphantly.<br />
  Sterno harrumphed. &quot;I don't think that's...&quot;<br />
  The Fly cut him off. &quot;Oh, I get it, it's a game, right?&quot; His<br />
  antennae waved excitedly. &quot;It's `Find the Paranoid', right?&quot; He<br />
  began bouncing up and down in his seat. &quot;I know! I know!&quot; He waved<br />
  his hands in the air excitedly, making incomprehensible gestures.<br />
  &quot;First syllable....sounds like...!&quot;<br />
  &quot;SHTOP DIS!&quot; the psychiatrist screamed angrily. From out of<br />
  nowhere, a riding crop had appeared in his hand. He was about to<br />
  lash out at the patient nearest him, when he noticed that everyone<br />
  was looking at him.<br />
  He stopped, and laughed weakly. He quickly tossed the riding<br />
  crop under a chair, and tried to regain his composure. &quot;Zo, uh,<br />
  where vere ve?&quot;<br />
  Ernie's eyes narrowed accusingly. &quot;You had a riding crop!&quot;<br />
  The Fly bounced up and down excitedly. &quot;Oh, wow! He had a<br />
  riding crop! He's not supposed to have that!&quot; He pointed an<br />
  accusing finger at the psychiatrist. &quot;Personal foul! Lose 10 yards!<br />
  Do not pass `Go', do NOT collect $200!&quot; He folded his arms<br />
  triumphantly.<br />
  The doctor smiled weakly. &quot;Uh, I can explain...&quot;<br />
  &quot;I bid twenty,&quot; the Fly interrupted. &quot;Three strikes and you're<br />
  out!&quot;<br />
  Ernie noticed a framed diploma hanging on the wall behind him.<br />
  He turned to read it. He looked at the diploma, and then at the<br />
  doctor, and then at the diploma again. &quot;Hey, guys!&quot; he called out<br />
  to the others excitedly. &quot;Do you know who this `doctor' is? He's<br />
  Dr. Heinz von Lie....&quot;<br />
  &quot;ENOUGH!&quot; The psychiatrist slammed a riding crop against the<br />
  seat of an empty chair, commanding everyone's attention. Ernie that<br />
  the first riding crop was still under an empty chair, where the<br />
  doctor had thrown it. He appeared to have an endless supply of<br />
  them.<br />
  &quot;All right!&quot; He took off the thin, pince-nez glasses he had<br />
  been wearing, tossed them aside, and replaced them with a monocle.<br />
  &quot;Zo, you haff discovered my true identity, eh?&quot; He laughed evilly.<br />
  Ernie was pretty sure that the doctor really was laughing evilly;<br />
  that he wasn't just imagining it. &quot;It does not matter,&quot; von<br />
  Liederkranz continued. &quot;The interrogation will proceed!&quot;<br />
  The Fly was confused. &quot;Interrogation? I thought it was<br />
  therapy?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Interrogation, therapy, what difference does it make?&quot; the<br />
  Nazi answered. &quot;It's all ze same thing!&quot;<br />
  Ernie pointed indignantly at Sterno. &quot;See?! And you thought I<br />
  was paranoid! You were wrong!&quot;<br />
  &quot;I was not!&quot; Sterno declared defensively. &quot;I still think<br />
  you're paranoid!&quot;<br />
  &quot;But...&quot; Ernie was totally taken aback.<br />
  &quot;Just because he's really a Nazi doesn't mean you're not<br />
  paranoid,&quot; Sterno continued self-importantly. &quot;Even paranoids have<br />
  enemies!&quot;<br />
  Ernie could only sputter with indignation.<br />
  The Fly looked at the Nazi accusingly. &quot;You said you were a<br />
  psychiatrist! We trusted you!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Ach, but I am!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Huh?&quot; The Fly was confused.<br />
  The Nazi explained. &quot;I told you, I am Sturmbannfuhrer Doktor<br />
  Heinz von Liederkranz! Und, vot kind of doctor did you tink I vas?&quot;<br />
  Sterno puffed thoughtfully on his cigar. &quot;That DOES make<br />
  sense,&quot; he admitted. &quot;After all, if a Nazi torturer were going to<br />
  be a doctor, then a psychiatrist would be the one to be!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Precisely,&quot; von Liederkranz agreed.<br />
  The Fly's antennae waved agitatedly. &quot;You're not going to<br />
  torture us, are you?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, no!&quot; laughed von Liederkranz. &quot;Ve don't do dat anymore!<br />
  Dat's barbaric!&quot; The Fly sighed with relief.<br />
  &quot;Now ve have psychiatry!&quot; the Nazi smiled evilly. &quot;It's MUCH<br />
  worse!&quot;<br />
  Ernie began edging slowly towards the door.<br />
  &quot;Don't bother!&quot; the psychiatrist called out. &quot;It's locked!&quot; <br />
  Ernie lunged for the door anyway. No-one made a move to stop<br />
  him. The door was solid steel, and securely locked. Ernie glumly<br />
  returned to his seat.<br />
  Von Liederkranz turned to Captain Memory. The Captain hadn't<br />
  been paying much attention to the proceedings. He was still<br />
  engrossed in the TV Guide. He appeared to be diligently searching<br />
  for something to watch other than Reptile shows.<br />
  The Nazi smiled malevolently. &quot;Zo, you didn't like ze Hot<br />
  Vhirling Corkscrew, eh?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory looked up annoyedly. &quot;Not THAT again!&quot;<br />
  Von Liederkranz laughed diabolically. &quot;Oh no, of COURSE not!<br />
  Ve have something, heh, heh, MUCH vorse!&quot; He peered closely at the<br />
  Captain. &quot;Your mother never liked you!&quot; he announced.<br />
  Captain Memory's eyes went wide with shock. &quot;Aaugghh!&quot; he<br />
  screamed, burying his head in his arms.<br />
  The Nazi chuckled sadistically. &quot;I told you, psychiatry is<br />
  MUCH vorse! Und much more effective!&quot; Ernie noticed that the Nazi<br />
  had discarded his cigar, and was now holding a cigarette in a long<br />
  holder. &quot;Now, vill you tell us how you gain access to the system?&quot;<br />
  Poor Captain Memory could only whimper.<br />
  Von Liederkranz didn't seem to mind that the Captain refused<br />
  to talk. It gave him more opportunity to practice his sadistic<br />
  psychiatry. &quot;Very vell,&quot; he smirked. &quot;You asked for it!&quot; He peered<br />
  intently at the Captain, choosing his words carefully. &quot;You're<br />
  totally inadequate!&quot;<br />
  &quot;NO!&quot; screamed Captain Memory, curling himself up into a tight<br />
  ball.<br />
  &quot;Heh, heh!&quot; the Nazi chuckled. He looked closely at Captain<br />
  Memory, preparing his next shot. &quot;You're...&quot;<br />
  The Captain couldn't take any more. &quot;Uh, 007C D0 C8!&quot; he<br />
  cried.<br />
  Suddenly, the scene vanished. Ernie staggered with vertigo,<br />
  and sat down heavily on the ground. His eyes stung as a gust of<br />
  wind blew sand in his face. His head swam, and he felt nauseous. He<br />
  closed his eyes tightly, and put a hand over his stomach. &quot;I think<br />
  I'm getting the flu,&quot; he moaned. <br />
  After a few moments, he opened his eyes, carefully wiping the<br />
  sand out of them. At first, all he could see was sand. Then he<br />
  looked up, and saw... &quot;The Pyramids!&quot; Ernie breathed, in awe.<br />
</p>
<p> <br />
  CHAPTER 10</p>
<p> Ernie looked around. The Fly was sitting in the sand,<br />
  attempting to make sand castles. Sterno was prowling around the<br />
  sand, obviously looking for something. Captain Memory was still<br />
  curled up in a ball.<br />
  Ernie struggled to his feet, and attempted to brush some of<br />
  the sand off himself. He walked over to where the Captain lay, and<br />
  tapped him on the shoulder. &quot;You can come out now. He's gone!&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory peeked out tentatively. He breathed a sigh of<br />
  relief, and uncurled, sitting up in the sand. &quot;Whew! I'm glad<br />
  that's over! That was awful!&quot;<br />
  The Fly peered at Captain Memory curiously. &quot;That stuff he was<br />
  saying, was it true? I mean, like, about your mother and<br />
  everything?&quot;<br />
  The Captain looked puzzled. &quot;Um, actually, I can't quite<br />
  recall. But if it had been, it would have been pretty awful,<br />
  wouldn't it?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Wow,&quot; said the Fly in agreement. He thought a moment. &quot;And<br />
  what about that stuff about being totally inad...&quot;<br />
  &quot;I don't want to talk about it!&quot; The Captain cut him off<br />
  irritatedly.<br />
  Ernie looked up, and once again beheld the majesty of the<br />
  Pyramids in the distance. They looked a lot newer than he<br />
  remembered them. &quot;Wow!&quot; he breathed. &quot;We must be in Ancient Egypt,<br />
  right?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory looked perplexed. &quot;Um, well, I could be wrong,<br />
  but I think we're on a beach in New Jersey!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Ah, well,&quot; Sterno chimed in, still sifting through the sand.<br />
  &quot;That explains all these cigarette butts and ring-pull tabs.&quot;<br />
  Ernie stared at him. &quot;What are you doing?&quot;<br />
  &quot;I seem to have dropped my lighter,&quot; Sterno explained. &quot;You<br />
  haven't seen it, have you?&quot;<br />
  Ernie looked around. &quot;Afraid not.&quot;<br />
  &quot;It's so difficult to find anything in this shifting sand!&quot;<br />
  Sterno stopped, and picked up something. &quot;Here's a penny.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, yeah?&quot; This might be a clue to they're location, Ernie<br />
  thought. &quot;What kind is it? A Lincoln?&quot;<br />
  Sterno turned the penny over. &quot;No, a Cadillac.&quot;<br />
  Ernie scratched his head. &quot;Well, that's close, I guess. What's<br />
  the date one it?&quot;<br />
  Sterno examined it closely. &quot;2,500 B.C.&quot;<br />
  Ernie's face lit up. &quot;Oh, that explains why the Pyramids look<br />
  new!&quot; He frowned. &quot;But, what are the Pyramids doing on a beach in<br />
  New Jersey?&quot;<br />
  &quot;I've got it!&quot; Sterno cried. <br />
  &quot;You do?&quot; asked Ernie in amazement. &quot;Great! What...&quot; He<br />
  stopped.<br />
  Sterno was holding a small object triumphantly aloft. &quot;I've<br />
  found it! I...&quot; He stopped. &quot;Wait a minute! This isn't my lighter!<br />
  It's just an old BIC!&quot; He flicked it. A small flame appeared. &quot;Oh<br />
  well,&quot; he sighed. &quot;I suppose it'll have to do.&quot; He placed it in his<br />
  invisible pocket.<br />
  Ernie looked at the Pyramids again. &quot;Uh, anyway, as I was<br />
  saying...&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory sighed loudly.<br />
  &quot;What's the matter?&quot; the Fly wanted to know.<br />
  Captain Memory shook his head sadly. &quot;It's a real bad sign<br />
  when you get Pyramids showing up on a beach in New Jersey.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Bad sign?&quot; The Fly's antennae waved nervously.<br />
  Captain Memory sighed. &quot;Yeah. It means that the fabric of<br />
  Cyberspace is coming apart. We're getting really close to that<br />
  final, total sys...&quot;<br />
  &quot;Don't say it!&quot; Ernie pleaded.<br />
  &quot;..tem..&quot; Captain Memory continued.<br />
  &quot;Please!&quot; Ernie begged.<br />
  The Captain stopped. &quot;Why not?&quot;<br />
  Ernie moaned. &quot;It makes my stomach hurt!&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory just shrugged. <br />
  Ernie moaned again.<br />
  &quot;Hey, guy,&quot; the Fly chimed in. He took a small package out of<br />
  one of his suit pockets and handed it to Ernie. &quot;Here's what you<br />
  need. Have some Rolaids!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh. Thanks.&quot; Ernie tried a few. Actually, they did seem to<br />
  help. Well, maybe a total system failure wasn't that bad, after<br />
  all.<br />
  &quot;So, what do you wanna do now, guys?&quot; the Fly piped up<br />
  brightly.<br />
  &quot;Beats me,&quot; answered Captain Memory.<br />
  &quot;Haven't the foggiest!&quot; replied Sterno absently. He was<br />
  engrossed in trying to light a cigar using the tiny flame from the<br />
  old BIC.<br />
  Ernie looked around. &quot;I dunno. What do you wanna do?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Wanna go see an ancient, undiscovered, tomb? That sounds like<br />
  fun, huh?&quot; The Fly's antennae waved expectantly.<br />
  &quot;Oh, let's!&quot; answered Sterno brightly. He was in a much better<br />
  mood, now that he'd gotten his cigar going.<br />
  Ernie frowned. &quot;How do you know where to find an ancient,<br />
  undiscovered tomb?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Simple,&quot; the Fly replied cheerfully. &quot;Just follow the signs!&quot;<br />
  He pointed to an object in the distance.<br />
  Ernie peered in the direction the Fly was pointing. Sure<br />
  enough, he could just barely make out a sign, which said `THIS WAY<br />
  TO THE ANCIENT, UNDISCOVERED TOMB', with an arrow pointing the way.<br />
  &quot;Well...&quot; Ernie wasn't sure this was going to be such a good<br />
  idea.<br />
  &quot;Aw, come on, guys!&quot; the Fly enthused. &quot;It'll be fun!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well...&quot; Ernie was unconvinced.<br />
  &quot;Do you have something better to do?&quot; Sterno demanded.<br />
  &quot;Well...&quot; Ernie hesitated.<br />
  &quot;That's settled then!&quot; Sterno stated with finality. He glared<br />
  at Ernie. &quot;And I DO wish you wouldn't keep repeating yourself all<br />
  the time!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well...&quot; Ernie began.<br />
  &quot;PLEASE!&quot; Sterno cut him off. Ernie decided to just be quiet.<br />
  The foursome trudged through the dry sand. Luckily the sun,<br />
  though bright, was not very hot. Ernie hoped they didn't have far<br />
  to go. Trying to walk through the shifting, blowing sand was very<br />
  tiring. The approached the sign.<br />
  The sign seemed to be pointing to something behind one of the<br />
  Pyramids. As they rounded the corner, they became able to see what<br />
  it was.<br />
  &quot;Wow!&quot; breathed Ernie in awe. A fabulous Egyptian temple stood<br />
  in front of them. Crumbling columns towered 200 feet into the sky,<br />
  supporting a sandstone roof that had collapsed at various points.<br />
  In the center of the temple stood a large stone structure with no<br />
  windows, and only one door, which was closed.<br />
  After a few moments, Ernie noticed that there was a small,<br />
  brightly-colored wooden building standing in front of the temple.<br />
  A sign on the little building said `SEE THE ANCIENT, UNDISCOVERED<br />
  TOMB! Admission: $2.00.'<br />
  Inside the small building was a portly, middle-aged man<br />
  wearing a bright plaid suit and a straw hat, and smoking a cigar.<br />
  &quot;Step right up, gentlemen!&quot; he cried to them. &quot;Yer just in time!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, wow!&quot; said the Fly, obviously excited. &quot;We wanna see the<br />
  tomb!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Of course you do, sonny,&quot; said the man, flicking the ash of<br />
  his cigar. &quot;Everybody wants to see the tomb! Let's see, there's<br />
  four at two dollars each...&quot; He looked the group over. &quot;I'll tell<br />
  you what I'm gonna do. Because I like yer, uh...&quot; He looked at the<br />
  Fly with puzzlement. &quot;...face, I'm gonna give you a special price.<br />
  Only $10 for all of ya!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Gee, thanks!&quot; said the Fly enthusiastically. Ernie opened his<br />
  mouth to speak.<br />
  &quot;Hey, that's okay, guys,&quot; the Fly cut him off. &quot;It's on me!&quot;<br />
  He handed the ticket-seller a $10 bill. <br />
  &quot;Step right on in, gentlemen!&quot; The ticket-seller gestured<br />
  towards the door of the tomb.<br />
  As they approached, Ernie examined the hieroglyphics on the<br />
  walls of the temple. Suddenly, one caught his eye. &quot;Look!&quot; He<br />
  pointed it out. &quot;It's the RCA dog! And the phonograph! This must<br />
  be...&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, your not going to start that `Dead Sea Phonograph<br />
  Records' business again, are you?&quot; Sterno said irritatedly.<br />
  &quot;Well...&quot; Ernie began.<br />
  &quot;Will you PLEASE stop saying that!&quot; Sterno cried in<br />
  exasperation. Ernie shut up.<br />
  The interior of the building did, in fact, look like an<br />
  ancient, undiscovered tomb. Mummy cases lined the walls. Strange<br />
  carved containers, some shaped like animals, lay on all sides.<br />
  Drifting sand lay piled up against everything. <br />
  &quot;Wow!&quot; The Fly was amazed. &quot;An ancient, undiscovered tomb! I<br />
  bet we're the first people to be in here in a zillion years!&quot;<br />
  An ancient wooden cabinet caught Ernie's attention. The figure<br />
  of the RCA dog was carved into it. Ernie opened it gingerly. &quot;Aha!&quot;<br />
  he cried. &quot;Look!&quot;<br />
  Inside, sure enough, was an ancient, acoustic Victrola-type<br />
  record player. Lined up neatly in slots were dozens of flat black<br />
  disks that could only be 78 rpm records. &quot;See?&quot; proclaimed Ernie.<br />
  &quot;I told you so! It's the Dead Sea Phonograph Records!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Cool!&quot; enthused the Fly. &quot;Play it!&quot;<br />
  Ernie was taken aback. This could be the greatest find of all<br />
  time! It could change the world; completely alter Life As We Know<br />
  It. He had to be very careful. One mistake might ruin the whole<br />
  thing. If he made the wrong move, the greatest discovery in history<br />
  might be lost forever - and it would be all his fault!  &quot;Um, play<br />
  it?&quot; Ernie hesitated uncomfortably. &quot;Um, I'm not sure...&quot;<br />
  &quot;Play it!&quot; demanded Sterno irritably. &quot;You've been going on<br />
  and on about this for...for...&quot; Sterno thought a moment. &quot;Actually,<br />
  for BILLIONS of years, now, and we're all just about sick of it!<br />
  All right, here it is! Now, play it, already!&quot;<br />
  Ernie looked over the machine warily. &quot;Um, I'm not exactly<br />
  sure how to work it.&quot; He tugged at one of the 78 rpm records. It<br />
  refused to come out of it's slot.<br />
  Sterno sighed in exasperation. &quot;It's simple enough! Look!&quot; He<br />
  pointed to a corroded metal strip on the bottom part of the<br />
  machine. There were a number of buttons on it, and a slot. Next to<br />
  the slot Ernie could just barely make out the words &quot;Insert Coin.&quot;<br />
  Ernie searched through his pockets. &quot;Um...&quot;<br />
  &quot;Oh, all right!&quot; Sterno snapped annoyedly. &quot;Here!&quot; He handed<br />
  Ernie the Cadillac penny.<br />
  &quot;Um, thanks.&quot; Ernie dropped the coin into the slot. For a<br />
  moment, nothing happened. Then, slowly, the ancient machine began<br />
  to creak into action. A small, dim, light appeared behind a little<br />
  square next to the slot. Brushing away the dust, Ernie could just<br />
  barely make out the words `Make Selection'.<br />
  &quot;Oh, wow,&quot; said Ernie. Next to each button was a small<br />
  rectangle, which was obviously supposed to contain the name of the<br />
  song. Unfortunately, most of them were so covered by dirt and<br />
  corrosion that Ernie couldn't read them.<br />
  &quot;Um, which one should I pick?&quot; he asked in confusion.<br />
  &quot;Who cares?&quot; barked Sterno in exasperation. &quot;Just pick<br />
  SOMETHING!&quot;<br />
  Ernie peered at the selections. He was desperately afraid of<br />
  making the wrong choice. This might be his only chance to learn the<br />
  Secret of the Universe, or something like that. He had to make the<br />
  right selection! Suddenly, he saw something he recognized. &quot;Hey,<br />
  look at this!&quot; He pointed at one of the selections. &quot;It's Sam the<br />
  Sham and the PHARAOHS! See, I told you...&quot;<br />
  &quot;Play it!&quot; Cried the Fly enthusiastically.<br />
  &quot;Play it!&quot; snapped Sterno annoyedly.<br />
  &quot;But...but...&quot; Ernie peered at it more closely. &quot;The song is<br />
  `Walk Like a Man!' I don't think Sam the Sham ever did that song!&quot;<br />
  &quot;PLAY IT!&quot; shrieked Sterno, his patience gone.<br />
  Ernie frowned. He looked at Captain Memory. The Captain just<br />
  shrugged. &quot;Well...&quot; Ernie said hesitantly. &quot;...okay.&quot; He pushed the<br />
  button.<br />
  The ancient machine slowly creaked into action. A 78 rpm<br />
  record dropped on to the platter, and the device began to play.<br />
  Within the first few notes, Ernie knew something had gone<br />
  terribly wrong. The music was growing louder with every second,<br />
  much louder than an old Victrola could ever have made it; in fact,<br />
  painfully loud. &quot;This isn't `Walk Like A Man'!&quot; Ernie cried. A<br />
  terrible realization hit him. If you took `Walk Like A Man', and<br />
  crossed it with Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs, you'd get...&quot;<br />
  Suddenly, it was all too clear. He recognized the music plainly<br />
  now. &quot;Oh, no!&quot; Ernie wailed. &quot;It's `Walk Like an Egyptian!'&quot;<br />
  &quot;What?!&quot; yelled Captain Memory. The music was too loud,<br />
  drowning out their words. He looked at the others. He could see<br />
  their mouths moving, but he couldn't hear a word they were saying.<br />
  The music was too loud, drowning out everything.<br />
  The music grew louder with every passing second. The pain<br />
  began to build in Ernie's head. He tried to cover his ears with his<br />
  hands, but found it very difficult to do while holding the coffee<br />
  maker. It didn't help, anyway. The music was so loud that it<br />
  vibrated through his hand, through his head. The whole temple was<br />
  vibrating!<br />
  Ernie looked at Captain Memory. &quot;Do something!&quot; he shouted.<br />
  The Captain shrugged and pointed to his ears, obviously meaning `I<br />
  can't hear a word you're saying.'&quot;<br />
  Ernie looked at Sterno and the Fly. They had their hands over<br />
  their ears, their eyes clenched tight in pain. Sterno especially<br />
  seemed to be suffering, his keen dog hearing more affected by the<br />
  sound than the others. <br />
  Ernie was miserable. Not only was he in pain from the terribly<br />
  loud music, but his very best idea ever, to go find the Dead Sea<br />
  Phonograph Records, had turned into a disaster. The music grew ever<br />
  louder. Ernie knew that excessive sound levels can be fatal. They<br />
  were all going to be killed by `Walk Like an Egyptian' played at a<br />
  million decibels - and he didn't even like that song!<br />
  Ernie tried to hold his hands more tightly over his ears. If<br />
  only the coffee maker wasn't in his way....Suddenly, it hit him!<br />
  The coffee maker! He set the selector to `Destroy', aimed it at the<br />
  ancient Victrola, and flipped the strength lever to `Full'.<br />
  Suddenly, the Victrola vanished - along with the cabinet, the<br />
  wall of the tomb, half the temple, and just about everything else<br />
  Ernie could see. In fact, Ernie now seemed to be standing at the<br />
  edge of a huge chasm. It was so broad that Ernie couldn't see the<br />
  other side; so deep that he couldn't see the bottom.<br />
  Ernie felt a tap on his shoulder. He turned. The Fly was<br />
  pointing at the opposite wall of the tomb, and saying something,<br />
  but Ernie couldn't make out what. Although the music had stopped<br />
  when the Victrola was destroyed, Ernie's ears were still ringing so<br />
  badly that he couldn't hear a thing. <br />
  Looking at the wall, Ernie guessed what the problem was.<br />
  Without the other side of the tomb to hold it up, the huge stone<br />
  wall was swaying. It looked as though it might crush them at any<br />
  moment.<br />
  Without thinking, Ernie aimed the coffee maker at the wall,<br />
  and flipped on the power switch. This time, his ears were just<br />
  barely recovered enough to hear the tremendous roar as the Psion<br />
  Megaforce Generator destroyed the other wall, and everything else,<br />
  for as far as the eye could see.<br />
  As the dust cleared, Ernie could see that where the opposite<br />
  wall had been, there was now what seemed to be a bottomless,<br />
  measureless chasm. On that side, too, there was a steep drop, as<br />
  though they were standing on the edge of an infinitely tall cliff.<br />
  All that remained was the 8-foot by 10 foot patch of sand and rock<br />
  which had been the inside of the tomb, where they now stood. <br />
  Looking around, all that Ernie could see was the little piece of<br />
  land that they were now standing on, and the sky. Everything else<br />
  appeared to have been disintegrated.<br />
  As the ringing in Ernie's ears slowly subsided, he began to<br />
  hear Captain Memory saying something.<br />
  &quot;Wow!&quot; The Captain was peeking over the edge of the precipice.<br />
  &quot;That Psion Megaforce Generator sure is powerful!&quot;<br />
  Ernie carefully peered over the brink. He tried to see the<br />
  bottom of the crater, but he couldn't see a thing. No, wait a<br />
  minute. He did see something; he saw....stars? How could there be<br />
  stars at the bottom of a hole?<br />
  The Fly peeked over the edge as well. &quot;Whew! That's some big<br />
  hole you blew there, buddy!&quot;<br />
  Ernie continued to peer into the hole, trying to make some<br />
  sense out of what he saw. He turned to Captain Memory. &quot;Um, how far<br />
  down does that hole go, anyway?&quot;<br />
  The Captain shook his head sadly. &quot;All the way!&quot; <br />
  &quot;Huh?&quot; Ernie was uncomprehending. &quot;All the way to where,<br />
  China?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory continued to peer downward. &quot;Further than that!<br />
  From the look of it, I'd say just about all the way to Mars!&quot; The<br />
  Captain shook his head sadly. &quot;You know, you really should read the<br />
  directions to those things before you use them!&quot;<br />
  Ernie looked at the coffee maker in dismay. He placed the it<br />
  carefully in the sand, and gingerly edged away from it. <br />
  &quot;Hey, this is really cool!&quot; the Fly continued to look over the<br />
  rim. &quot;I can see stars looking down,&quot; he looked up, &quot;AND looking<br />
  up!&quot; He peered over the opposite edge. &quot;Hey, there's stars on all<br />
  sides! Neat! How did you do that?&quot;<br />
  Sterno stared at Ernie, his eyes widening in horror. &quot;You<br />
  didn't!&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory shook his head sorrowfully. &quot;He did!&quot;<br />
  &quot;What?&quot; demanded Ernie. &quot;What did I do?&quot;<br />
  Sterno seemed to be in a state of shock. &quot;You mean, that one<br />
  little device could...&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory nodded dismally. &quot;I'm afraid so!&quot;<br />
  &quot;WHAT?&quot; Ernie was becoming very agitated.<br />
  Sterno glared balefully at Ernie. &quot;How could you DO such a<br />
  thing?!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Will somebody please tell me what I did?!&quot; Ernie wailed.<br />
  Captain Memory sighed. &quot;Well, let me put it to you this way.<br />
  You see this little patch of ground we're standing on? That's all<br />
  that's left!&quot;<br />
  &quot;All that's left of what?&quot; Ernie wasn't following this at all.<br />
  &quot;Of the planet Earth!&quot; the Captain declared morosely.<br />
  &quot;WHAT!?&quot; Ernie was horrified.<br />
  Captain Memory shook his head dejectedly. &quot;I'm afraid you blew<br />
  just about the entire planet away! Everything except the little<br />
  patch we're standing on!&quot; He peeked over the edge. &quot;Looks like you<br />
  nailed the moon, too.&quot; <br />
  &quot;But...But...&quot; Ernie protested weakly. &quot;How could that<br />
  HAPPEN!?&quot;<br />
  The Captain sighed. &quot;I told you that thing was powerful!&quot; He<br />
  continued peering over the edge. Something caught his eye. He<br />
  brightened. &quot;Ah, good! That's a relief!&quot;<br />
  &quot;What?!&quot; Ernie was desperate for any good news.<br />
  Captain Memory smiled. &quot;You'll be glad to know that Mars is<br />
  fine! The blast didn't even touch it!&quot; He peered more closely. &quot;It<br />
  might be a little off it's orbit, but aside from that it's<br />
  perfectly okay!&quot;<br />
  Ernie moaned. <br />
  Suddenly, Captain Memory straightened up. He began looking in<br />
  all directions, a look of consternation on his face. &quot;Something's<br />
  happening!&quot;<br />
  Sterno glared at Ernie. &quot;This is all your fault!&quot;<br />
  The Fly put his hands up to his head. &quot;Oh, wow! My head!<br />
  It's...What's happening to me?&quot;<br />
  Ernie's jaw dropped in amazement. The Fly's head was beginning<br />
  to...change. As the others watched in astonishment, the Fly's head<br />
  shimmered, disappeared, and was replaced by the perfectly normal-<br />
  looking head of a man in his mid 30's.<br />
  &quot;Whoo!&quot; complained the Fly. &quot;I feel really weird!&quot; He<br />
  squinted. &quot;There's something wrong with my eyes! I can't see too<br />
  good anymore!&quot; <br />
  &quot;You're....you're normal!&quot; Ernie gasped in astonishment.<br />
  The Fly put his hands up to his head, feeling out it's shape.<br />
  &quot;Oh, wow! It's my old head! I got it back!&quot;<br />
  Ernie turned to Captain Memory is helpless astonishment.<br />
  &quot;What's happening!?&quot; <br />
  Captain Memory, too, looked amazed. &quot;It's the game! We've<br />
  ended the game!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Of course!&quot; Sterno caught his drift immediately. &quot;By<br />
  destroying most of the world, you've brought the game to an end!<br />
  There's not enough of the planet left to play with!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Right!&quot; Captain Memory beamed. &quot;And you've done it within the<br />
  logical confines of the program! Using materials found within the<br />
  program, in a manner consistent with the program's logic!&quot; Captain<br />
  Memory reached out to shake Ernie's hand. &quot;Good job!&quot;<br />
  Sterno looked ruefully over the edge of the chasm. &quot;Of course,<br />
  I don't think we got very many points!&quot;<br />
  &quot;It doesn't matter,&quot; said Captain Memory cheerfully. &quot;It's<br />
  `Game Over'. That's all we need!&quot;<br />
  Ernie was finding this all difficult to follow. &quot;So, now<br />
  what?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Now the system shuts down, in an orderly manner, and we're<br />
  all free!&quot; cried the Captain jubilantly. &quot;The evil genius Waldo<br />
  Stadium is thwarted, his Cyberslaves are set free! We win!&quot;<br />
  Ernie's eyes narrowed. &quot;You talk about all of this almost as<br />
  if it was a game!&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory seemed taken aback. &quot;Did I?&quot; he said<br />
  innocently. &quot;Well, I'm sure I didn't mean to....&quot; He trailed off.<br />
  Meanwhile, the Fly was engrossed in examining his head. He had<br />
  pulled out a small pocket mirror, and was looking himself over<br />
  carefully. &quot;Hey, this is great!&quot; he enthused. &quot;I've got my looks<br />
  back! The babes are gonna love it! Awright! It's time to PA-A-A-<br />
  RTY!&quot;<br />
  Ernie looked around thoughtfully. There wasn't much to see.<br />
  All that was left of the planet Earth was the little patch of<br />
  ground that they stood on. &quot;What's...what's going to happen to us<br />
  now?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well...&quot; Captain Memory scratched his head. &quot;I guess we'll<br />
  all be going home!&quot;<br />
  Sterno put a paw over his stomach. &quot;I...I feel very strange!&quot;<br />
  he complained. &quot;I...&quot; Suddenly, Sterno shimmered, and disappeared!<br />
  Ernie was aghast. &quot;Oh my god, he's gone! What happened to<br />
  him?&quot;<br />
  &quot;It's beginning,&quot; Captain Memory replied calmly. &quot;We're all <br />
  going back to our proper place and time....&quot; the Captain hesitated.<br />
  &quot;...wherever that is!&quot;<br />
  &quot;We're going back?&quot; the Fly was enthusiastic. &quot;AWRIGHT!&quot; He,<br />
  too, had begun to shimmer. He flashed Ernie the `thumbs up' sign.<br />
  &quot;It's PARTY TIME!!&quot; With that, he was gone.<br />
  Now there was only Ernie and Captain Memory. &quot;But...but what<br />
  should I do when I get back?&quot; Ernie wanted to know. &quot;I mean, after<br />
  all this, shouldn't I....I dunno, DO something?&quot;<br />
  Captain Memory shrugged. &quot;I guess you'll just have to wait and<br />
  see!&quot; Suddenly, Ernie felt ill. The world began to shimmer around<br />
  him. The Captain's shape was becoming vague and indistinct. The<br />
  last thing Ernie saw was the Captain gazing ruefully at his bare<br />
  wrist. &quot;I sure wish I could have gotten a watch, though!&quot; he said<br />
  sadly. With that, the scene vanished.</p>
<p> EPILOGUE</p>
<p> Ernie's head swan. The strange, distorted shapes of a surreal<br />
  landscape swirled around him. He stumbled backwards, and his hand<br />
  fell upon a doorknob. Reflexively, he pulled it open and stepped<br />
  through.<br />
  A bright, fluorescent light dazzled his eyes. He became aware<br />
  of the sound of many voices in the distance. He staggered forward.<br />
  &quot;All done?&quot; A girl's voice startled Ernie. He looked up. He<br />
  was back at the Arcade! &quot;Did you have a nice game?&quot; the girl at the<br />
  information booth was asking him, twirling a finger through her<br />
  hair absent-mindedly.<br />
  &quot;Uh...&quot; Ernie could only mumble.<br />
  &quot;HowEVER did you get that loincloth so dirty!&quot; she reproved,<br />
  cracking her chewing gum loudly. &quot;There's a five dollar cleaning<br />
  fee for that, you know!&quot;<br />
  Ernie's mind was slowly clearing. &quot;Uh, yeah?...&quot; he managed to<br />
  answer.<br />
  &quot;You can change in there,&quot; the girl pointed to a dressing<br />
  room. &quot;When you return the loincloth and the broadsword, you'll get<br />
  your deposit back,&quot; she looked at him pointedly. &quot;Minus the five-<br />
  dollar cleaning fee!&quot;<br />
  As Ernie changed, his mind began to clear. Putting his own<br />
  clothes on again made him feel almost...normal. Had all of this<br />
  really happened, or had it all been just an illusion? Maybe it was<br />
  all just a malfunctioning computer program? Ernie couldn't be sure.<br />
  Ernie walked slowly home from the Arcade, trying to put his<br />
  mind in order. He looked carefully at everything he passed. For<br />
  some reason it seemed to him that things would be somehow<br />
  different. Yet, the neighborhood looked about the same, as far as<br />
  he could tell. But then again, he'd never really paid that much<br />
  attention to all the details. Some of them might be different, and<br />
  he'd never even notice.<br />
  After what seemed a very long time, he approached his own<br />
  house. He examined it carefully. It looked the same, as far as he<br />
  could tell. He took a deep breath, and went inside.<br />
  &quot;Hello, dear,&quot; he heard his mother's voice come from the<br />
  kitchen. &quot;Did you have a nice game?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Uh, I guess...&quot; he called out in reply. &quot;It was... uh...<br />
  different!&quot;<br />
  &quot;That's nice!&quot; his mother answered. &quot;Dinner's ready!&quot;<br />
  Ernie walked into the dining room. He was still feeling pretty<br />
  woozy. Maybe something to eat would make him feel better.<br />
  Ernie's mother entered, carrying a large covered dish. Ernie<br />
  gasped. &quot;Mom! Your hair...!&quot;<br />
  Ernie's mother looked confused. &quot;What about my hair?&quot;<br />
  &quot;It...it's green!&quot; Ernie choked.<br />
  &quot;But it's always been green!&quot; his mother was puzzled. &quot;Are you<br />
  feeling all right, dear boy?&quot;<br />
  Ernie collapsed into a chair. &quot;No,&quot; he moaned. &quot;I don't feel<br />
  good at all!&quot;<br />
  &quot;It must be that awful Virtual Reality Game,&quot; his mother said<br />
  knowingly. &quot;I've always said those things were unhealthy! It's just<br />
  too much stimulation for young minds!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Uh, yeah,&quot; Ernie agreed pitifully.<br />
  &quot;Have some dinner and you'll feel better!&quot; she said wisely,<br />
  dishing out a plate of food for Ernie. &quot;I've made your favorite:<br />
  squid with mothballs!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Uh...&quot; Ernie began.<br />
  &quot;Your favorite TV show's on tonight,&quot; his mother continued<br />
  cheerily. &quot;`I Wanna Donna' with Donna the Iguana! In fact,&quot; she<br />
  went on brightly. &quot;All your favorite Reptiles are on tonight!&quot;<br />
  Ernie sighed deeply. Well, he thought. It looks like I'm home!<br />
  Sort of.<br />
