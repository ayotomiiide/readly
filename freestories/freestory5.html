  `Anyone who has not worked for them<br />
  simply cannot understand them.'</p>
<p> - Mille Vennamun, introduction to:<br />
  `The Use of Ashes: Bureau of Procuration Manual'</p>
<p> Half past eight.  The bedside alarm woke Kelanie up with the<br />
  sampled victory-screech of some carnivorous xenoform.  She was up<br />
  immediately, eyes wide, fingers clawing the pillow-pads, gasping with<br />
  shock as the subconsciously-induced adrenalin shivered through her<br />
  system.   As she calmed down, her pupils dilated out from crisis-<br />
  induced pinpricks, her breathing and pulse rates returned to normal,<br />
  and she wondered, not for the first or last time, if life was like<br />
  this in the private sector.   She scrambled off the bed as it began<br />
  to deflate and retract into the wall.<br />
  Her personalised holographic news service activated as she stepped<br />
  into the shower.   It took the appearance of an old man dressed in a<br />
  monk's habit, who bore a strong resemblance to William S. Burroughs.<br />
  It leered at her, and croaked,<br />
  `Rough night last night?'   She pushed the oxygen control with the<br />
  heel of her hand, took a few deep snorts.   Under the stream of<br />
  high-pressure hot water, she soaped herself and replied,<br />
  `Mind your own ratty business, line-noise.   What's on the agenda<br />
  for today?'   The news laughed, wheezing and rasping.<br />
  `Come on, seriously!   I refuse to believe that you don't remember<br />
  the event you have been awaiting, for - how long has it been?'   She<br />
  turned off the shower, snorted some more oxygen and, with a warm<br />
  towel over her shoulders, found some clean underwear and a long<br />
  jumper she had only worn three times since it was washed last.<br />
  `Three months.   You can assume that I've been on the ExPort<br />
  waiting list for so long that I've forgotten where I'm supposed to be<br />
  going.   Put on some music and refresh my memory.'   The news spoke<br />
  over the soft sounds of a song by `This Mortal Coil':<br />
  `You are due at the NoSan'No'Os ExPort at nine-thirty, to check in<br />
  for your pre-flight examination and briefing.'  Kelanie, vigorously<br />
  towelling her hair and wondering if she had time for her pelvic<br />
  exercises, looked up.<br />
  `The ship's in, is it?'<br />
  `Due to arrive this afternoon, departs for Copperla, Syndaine and<br />
  other points towards galactic centre at eleven-fifty this morning.'<br />
  She smiled wryly.<br />
  `&quot;Other points towards galactic centre&quot;, eh?  As a government<br />
  agency, aren't we entitled to more detailed information than that?'<br />
  The news lowered its simulated holographic eyebrows and intoned,<br />
  `The NoSan'No'Os still refuse to recognise the Interim Government.<br />
  It is their opinion that, since the Maracites have only been in<br />
  office for ninety-two years, that they cannot be treated seriously.'<br />
  Kelanie found one of her mech boots, and, while looking through the<br />
  closet for the other, retorted, her voice muffled,<br />
  `Stuff &quot;seriously&quot;... &quot;decency&quot;, or &quot;common courtesy&quot; would be<br />
  nice.'  The news, which was a sub-contracted system of the<br />
  NoSan'No'Os, replied in a carefully neutral tone,<br />
  `I will remind Miss Camden that the NoSan'No'Os still regard<br />
  humanity as little better than animals, and that NoSan'No'Os<br />
  transport services are supplied to xenoforms with a much greater<br />
  level of social sophistication than humanity, with an equal level of<br />
  disregard for what you term &quot;decency&quot; or &quot;common courtesy&quot;.  All are<br />
  Equal.  None Is Favored.'  This was said with the assurance of an<br />
  aphorism.  She said nothing as she found her other boot.  She sipped<br />
  lemyn juice from the dispenser as she cold-booted her boots; they<br />
  shuddered, purred and beeped as their diagnostic routines finished.<br />
  `Okay.  Any more on my assignment?'<br />
  `Nuh-uh.'<br />
  `Sigh... okay, where did I leave my notepad?'<br />
  `I think it's under the heap of clothes next to the dryer.'  She<br />
  retrieved it, and tapped the function key to open a channel to the<br />
  transport pool.<br />
  `Single to the NoSan'No'Os ExPort by nine-thirty.'  While waiting<br />
  for a response, she threw some more clothes in a mesh bag.  The<br />
  xenoform in the Transport department gurgled back at her, and a touch<br />
  of exasperation sharpened her tone.  `Is there anyone down there who<br />
  speaks Anglic?'<br />
  `Foogle.'  replied the xenoform.<br />
  `Oh, line-noise.' she retorted.</p>
<p> *           *           *           *           *</p>
<p> NoSan'No'Os:  (from &quot;Nos-a-Nos&quot;, pre-reconciliation Scriptive,<br />
  &quot;Circle within the Circle&quot;) Dominant ruling<br />
  bureaucracy controlling more than ninety thousand<br />
  systems by virtue of monopoly on information,<br />
  transport and energy-conversion technology.</p>
<p> - Foley's `Unofficial Documents'</p>
<p> She climbed into the transport through the roof-hatch and slid into<br />
  the seat.  The driver said in a buzzing accent,<br />
  `Of destination, be in state of definition.'  She replied,<br />
  `NoSan'No'Os ExPort, and put some wings on it, hey?'  As she<br />
  buckled the safety belt, the driver's head rotated one hundred and<br />
  eighty degrees, and she found herself looking into the faceted eyes<br />
  of something resembling a six-foot stick insect.<br />
  `Of wings, be in state of indicating correct placement.'  it<br />
  chirred through its cheap translator.<br />
  `Just drive, okay?  The NoSan'No'Os ExPort.'  The driver slowly<br />
  waved its antennae, staring at her, and then turned back to the<br />
  control column and instrument panel.  As the transport lifted from<br />
  the ground and into the stream of AV traffic overhead, the driver hit<br />
  a key on its heads-up array with a mandible, and the vehicle was<br />
  filled with raucous mariachi music.  Gritting her teeth, Kelanie<br />
  paged through the Species ID section of her notepad, until she<br />
  identified the driver as a lower-caste Kaelen.   Reading further:</p>
<p> `... when requesting respectful silence for the involved<br />
  &quot;Hive Separation&quot; ritual, the Kaelen Queen emits a<br />
  pheromone (scent chem.ref 976541) and emits a traditional<br />
  &quot;cry of distress&quot; screech-tone (hear aud.ref 976537)'</p>
<p> She patched the audio reference through to her notepad, held it up<br />
  so that the point speaker was just behind the Kaelen's backwards-<br />
  pointing resonator-plate, and keyed it.  It played louder than she<br />
  expected, and the transport almost fell out of the traffic stream as<br />
  the Kaelen frantically chewed at the heads-up array controls.  The<br />
  music cut off in mid-trumpet-bray.<br />
  `Of interpersonal relationships, being placed in situation of<br />
  obligation due to social error.'  She kept reading until she had<br />
  finished the section on the Kaelen lower caste.<br />
  When the transport had settled on the concrete pad at the southern<br />
  edge of the NoSan'No'Os ExPort, she climbed out and tapped the<br />
  driver's side window, which lowered with the grinding sound of<br />
  poorly-lubricated biotech fairings.<br />
  `Of interpersonal relationship, emphasis! placed in situation of<br />
  obligation due to error.'  She held up her right hand, made a fist,<br />
  splayed her fingers and said,<br />
  `Of large-array social status, in state of adjusted obligation.',<br />
  which meant, in effect, that humanity was in some way indebted to the<br />
  Kaelen and this exchange had mitigated that debt somewhat.  She<br />
  smiled, and the Kaelen's antennae flattened out.  She was impressed;<br />
  here was a lower-caste xenoform that could interpret human facial<br />
  expressions.  Most xenos didn't bother.  This Kaelen was probably a<br />
  university student.<br />
  She strolled across the expanse of concrete, swinging the mesh bag,<br />
  shading her eyes from the morning sun with her forearm.  Apart from<br />
  the control/customs bunker, the ExPort resembled a series of linked<br />
  concrete ovals.   As she crossed the lower of six outer landing pads,<br />
  she half-expected to see a cricket pitch set in the middle.<br />
  She was met at the warehouse-sized door of the bunker by a boy who<br />
  appeared to be about twelve years old, wearing bright green shorts<br />
  and t-shirt, and skate-board pads on his knees.  He brushed aside a<br />
  wayward fringe of carrot-coloured hair, and waved to her.<br />
  `Miss Camden?  Bureau of Procuration?  Hi, i'm Denkaster, Port<br />
  Administrator.'  She followed him into the open-space office and took<br />
  the seat he offered her.  `Do you have your medical records handy?'<br />
  he asked, sorting through a pile of fiche plates on his cluttered<br />
  desk.  She nodded, and touched the Match Fields key on her notepad,<br />
  which emitted the familiar `screeee' sound of notepads matching<br />
  carrier frequencies.  While the notepads exchanged handshaking<br />
  signals and then information, she asked,<br />
  `Do you know where this transport is going?  after Syndaine, that<br />
  is?' Denkaster sighed, found the fiche he was looking for and<br />
  replied,<br />
  `'fraid not... you know the NoSan'No'Os, never tell us anything.<br />
  Although I do have some notes from your section head on Syndaine that<br />
  relate to your assignment... your notepad should have them now.'  She<br />
  thanked him absently and started paging through file areas looking<br />
  for the information, which had been, as usual, mis-keyed as<br />
  `corrections to existing documentation'.</p>
<p> Sitting in the departures lounge, Kelanie read the notes.  She was<br />
  expected to travel to `Millimillenary' (a central exchange for<br />
  passengers of the NoSan'No'Os, ninety-five light years away), and to<br />
  `entertain' an executive of the Tendeysharhi, a species she had never<br />
  heard of.  In fact, her notepad had never heard of them either.<br />
  `Wonderful.  How the hell am I supposed to work with a sentient<br />
  that I've never seen before?'.  Reading on, she noted with rising<br />
  indignation that Starkey, her section head, expected her to interview<br />
  the members of the Tendeysharhi entourage, with a view to picking up<br />
  the proper etiquette and approach.  Angrily, she punched Starkey's<br />
  phone number into her notepad.<br />
  Starkey answered, though as usual, she employed video filters to<br />
  prevent anyone from identifying her.  In a weary voice, Kelanie<br />
  asked,<br />
  `Okay, Robyn, what's the big deal?  How am I supposed to make it<br />
  with an alien that the Registry hasn't even heard of?   Line-noise, I<br />
  don't even know if it's an oxygen-breather!'<br />
  `Kelanie, dearest... how are you?' Robyn's filtered voice only just<br />
  matched the aliased squares that represented her lips, and again<br />
  Kelanie wondered if she was working for an artificial intelligence.<br />
  If this was the case, Kelanie was not surprised that Starkey wanted<br />
  to keep it quiet, given the NoSan'No'Os' restrictions on<br />
  machine-based consciousness.<br />
  `I'm just a tad apprehensive about giving a blow-job to something<br />
  which may or may not have a dick, that's all!'  Kelanie replied<br />
  sarcastically.   Robyn held up a hand, palm out.  It appeared as a<br />
  mass of pale pink squares on the display projected by Kelanie's<br />
  notepad.<br />
  `I know, I know... this was dumped in my lap, and I don't know any<br />
  more about it than you, although we're laying even money that it has<br />
  something to do with the Humanist faction in the Maracites-' Robyn<br />
  stopped when she saw the &quot;I don't want to get drawn into another<br />
  tedious political argument&quot; expression on Kelanie's face.  `- and...<br />
  well, at the base level, it's to seal a trade agreement with the<br />
  Tendeysharhi.  What else can I say?'<br />
  `You could tell me something about Millimillenary, for a start...<br />
  have you ever been there?'  Kely thought she detected a smile on<br />
  Robyn's face.<br />
  `Once.  There are other humans there, I believe.  And despite what<br />
  you've undoubtedly heard of the NoSan'No'Os, you won't be treated<br />
  like a sardine in a tin.  Their ships are often nearly empty, when<br />
  heading back towards the Centre.'  Kelanie tilted her head to one<br />
  side, staring at the surrealist image that her notepad was showing.<br />
  `Robyn... what do you think about the NoSan'No'Os?'  This time, she<br />
  was sure that Robyn smiled, before giving the Bureau salute (pressing<br />
  the back of her hand to her lips) and hanging up.</p>

<p> `The Parkry are a biological anomaly; hive creatures,<br />
  evolved from a much smaller insectoid form, developing<br />
  lungs to replace the smaller-scale spiracle system, and<br />
  yet not developing voices to go with them.  They rely<br />
  completely on written or electronic means of<br />
  communication, and are thus ideally suited to the<br />
  administrative positions that they occupy in the<br />
  NoSan'No'Os' structure.  They are entirely pacifistic,<br />
  having no territorial imperatives beyond a vague sense of<br />
  duty to the hive; an evolutionary memory that has been,<br />
  for the most part, replaced with a sense of duty towards<br />
  the NoSan'No'Os.'</p>
<p> - Martini Baton, `What the Hell is THAT?', Chapter Two</p>
<p> She didn't hear the ship arrive, being absorbed in her search<br />
  through the ExPort's closed database for information relating to the<br />
  Tendeysharhi.  Looking out of the warehouse-sized doors, she noticed<br />
  that the sky now appeared to be overcast.  However, sunlight glinted<br />
  off the metallic edges of a nearby building, and she saw signs of<br />
  activity around her.  She stood, stretched, and sauntered over to the<br />
  nearest gate.  Outside and overhead, she could see the bottom of some<br />
  huge curved shape, patterned like stained concrete, slowly sinking to<br />
  the ground.  On the base of the ship, directly in line with the gate<br />
  she stood in was an oval gap, about twice as wide as the gate,<br />
  completely dark, as if filled with black glass.  The glass appeared<br />
  to melt from the centre towards the edges, and stevedores began<br />
  shifting cargo trolleys.  They took care to avoid the short figures<br />
  dressed in dark grey that scuttled out on four legs from the rear of<br />
  the ship's cargo bay.  Kelanie knew them; Parkry, hive creatures who<br />
  made up most of the administrative staff of the NoSan'No'Os.  One of<br />
  them turned its blank, golden-eyed, mouthless face to her and<br />
  beckoned with a three-jointed arm.  It didn't wait to see if she<br />
  followed, merely turned and trotted back into the ship.</p>
<p> `This is it?' she peered into the round hatch, about a metre wide,<br />
  with an expression of distaste.  The silent Parkry glanced at her<br />
  from underneath the brow of its curiously flattened head, pointed<br />
  again, executed a 180-degree turn on its four stick-insect-like legs<br />
  and left.  She shrugged, hefted her mesh bag and climbed through.  It<br />
  was smaller than her apartment; spherical, lined with something like<br />
  grey foam rubber.  There was a faint smell of aphrodisia incense, as<br />
  if the berth had previously been occupied by Kabouter-hippies.  No<br />
  bed, datapoint or light-source, apart from the sodium glow that came<br />
  from the corridor.  She sat crosslegged in the middle of the floor,<br />
  tossed her mesh bag aside; it rolled down the curve of the room to<br />
  rest against her leg.  When she activated her notepad, she was<br />
  surprised to find that the ship had a local data service, albeit a<br />
  limited one, offering little more than expected departure time and a<br />
  simple interactive map of the ship, with restricted areas marked by<br />
  the NoSan'No'Os segmented circle-starburst symbol.  There were other<br />
  areas in this data service to explore, but she decided to leave them<br />
  alone for the moment, not through prudence in not disturbing the<br />
  NoSan'No'Os, but to leave her something to do during the trip, which<br />
  would take between three and seven days, if the translation was<br />
  accurate.<br />
  According to the info postings from this system, the ship was under<br />
  way, and had already left earth orbit.  She felt no acceleration or<br />
  other sense of motion; leaving her bag and fixing the berth's<br />
  location in her backbrain, she decided to try and find a window.<br />
  Robyn was right; the ship was almost deserted.  In ten minutes'<br />
  wandering through the series of corridors that radiated from a<br />
  central shaft, she only saw four Parkry, who scuttled by, tacitly<br />
  ignoring her, and something like a six-legged Saint Bernard, which<br />
  circled her while she stood stock-still, too cautious to make any<br />
  possibly offensive moves.  It stopped, looked up at her (this was the<br />
  impression she got, though the xenoform lacked obvious visual organs)<br />
  and then ran off.  She breathed a deep sigh of relief, and then<br />
  started looking for a toilet.<br />
  She allowed herself a slight measure of distress when she began to<br />
  suspect that the Tertiary language didn't even have a word that<br />
  related to the concept of `toilet'.  She eventually found a vague<br />
  reference to an organic recycling service and proceeded to the map<br />
  reference.  It was a room very much like her berth, lined with grey<br />
  sponge plastic, sealed with a weak field that contained the faint<br />
  odour of chemicals and containing a water-filled pit.  She wrinkled<br />
  her nose in distaste, but after assuring herself that she was alone,<br />
  proceeded to use the facilities.  She then made her way back to her<br />
  berth, with the firm intention of spending the rest of the trip in a<br />
  state of low- metabolic-rate sleep.</p>
<p> When she got there, she found a large cat in her berth.</p>
<p> When she climbed in to the room, the moggy awoke immediately, fixed<br />
  its emerald gaze on her and put its ears back.  She froze.  It looked<br />
  like a very tall, thin, wiry humanoid covered with thick, banded grey<br />
  fur and with strangely jointed legs.  And a tail, which was now<br />
  slowly lashing to and fro behind it.  There were fluffy tufts of<br />
  white fur poking out of its ears, and a mat of similar fur running<br />
  down its chest.  It yowled something, to which her notepad could only<br />
  beep apologetically; fortunately, it had its own translator, which<br />
  snarled something like `Anyhah-araha eiyaha' at her, followed by some<br />
  sort of insectoid chittering.  She spoke to the xenoform's<br />
  translator.<br />
  `Terrestrial Anglic, thank you.'  The translator, shaped something<br />
  like a flattened bottle, made some purring noises, and then said in<br />
  Anglic,<br />
  `My room, my territory.  I was here first.  Mine.'  She pointed to<br />
  her bag, which the xeno had apparently opened and gone through,<br />
  spreading her clothes over the floor of the berth.<br />
  `My bag.  My property.  It was here before you were, my claim to<br />
  this territory.'  The xeno narrowed its eyes and growled softly.  She<br />
  continued, `I will call a Parkry, they will decide -' the xeno<br />
  yowled, and the translator interrupted hastily.<br />
  `No, no, I am content to share.  I will sleep in the middle.  Do<br />
  not make excessive noise or excrete on the floor.'  She was about to<br />
  say something like &quot;well, just who the hell do you think you are,<br />
  buster?&quot; when she remembered previous experiences with alien language<br />
  translators, and she kept her silence.  The Xenoform curled up into a<br />
  compact ball, lashed its tail around it and closed its eyes warily.<br />
  She sighed, and carefully lay down beside it, smiling bemusedly when<br />
  she heard it start to purr.  She composed herself and began the<br />
  mental exercises to prepare for a period of extended sleep.  She<br />
  slowed her breathing, inserted some links into her sub-conscious to<br />
  awaken her if her notepad should sound an alarm for any reason, and<br />
  then drifted off into a deep, dreamless sleep.<br />
  She woke to find that the xeno had shifted and was sleeping with<br />
  its forepaws across her hips, its head against the small of her back.<br />
  The soft purring had deepened to a husky `brrr', and she woke fully<br />
  when it gently butted its head against her back and made a small<br />
  `riowr' sound.  She tried to turn without moving her body from the<br />
  shoulders down, an d could see one large paw, the size of a tennis<br />
  raquet, with three-centimetre-long claws extending and sheathing<br />
  reflexively, making tiny indentations in the bare flesh of her hip.<br />
  Proceeding with caution, she took the paw in her free hand and gently<br />
  lifted it.  The claws quivered, and then extended to their full five<br />
  centimetres, clutching her hip in their broad span, the points of the<br />
  claws sinking in a few millimetres.<br />
  `Excuse me.' she murmured.  The xeno's translator ignored her.<br />
  `HEY!' she shouted.  The xenoform awoke with a start, digging its<br />
  claws further into her hip.  She twitched, but remained where she<br />
  was.<br />
  `Take your paw off me.'  The xeno's translator paused for a long<br />
  moment, and then yowled at the xeno in its native language.  The xeno<br />
  sheathed its claws, flicked its ears back momentarily, and curled up<br />
  again, excluding her from its personal space.  She turned over,<br />
  closed her eyes and composed herself for sleep again; within half an<br />
  hour, the xeno had its paw on her hip again, whereupon the ywent<br />
  through the same procedure; and again some two hours after that,<br />
  after which she gave up and went to sleep in the passageway.</p>
<p> She regained consciousness two days later, to visit the toilet<br />
  again.  She slowly stretched, licked her dry lips, and then noticed<br />
  the xeno sitting curled up at her feet, like a doormat patterned in<br />
  grey stripes, outside the berth.  It was gazing at her intently.  It<br />
  yowled, and its translator said,<br />
  `You sleep.  Why?'<br />
  `No food.  Little water.  Not hungry when asleep.' The xeno's ears<br />
  flattened when the translator reported this.  It uncurled from its<br />
  station at her feet, entered the berth (on all fours), and emerged<br />
  with a bloody haunch of raw meat in its jaws.  She went pale, and<br />
  backed away slightly when the xeno offered it to her.  It regarded<br />
  her with an air of obvious surprise for a moment, waggled its ears<br />
  and then tore into the meat itself, keeping a wary eye on her.</p>

<p> `The Tendeysharhi are a classic example of parallel<br />
  evolution, in that they resemble, superficially, large<br />
  felines, and many feline traits, including an acute sense<br />
  of territoriality, feline language structure (which tends<br />
  towards subtly-intoned yowls and screeches) and a<br />
  tendency to shed large amounts of fur at certain times of<br />
  the year.  The females are noticeably more violent and<br />
  territorial than their mates.  The Tendeysharhi did not<br />
  develop a science sufficient to begin space exploration<br />
  on their own; they were `apprenticed' to the Moridani<br />
  before the Purge, and were allowed to join the<br />
  NoSan'No'Os as a subject race after it.'</p>
<p> - Martini Baton, `What the Hell is THAT?', Chapter Five</p>
<p> The hatch melted away, and a breeze wafted into the entry hold,<br />
  carrying with it the strange fragrance of another world.  The light<br />
  had a golden-bronze hue to it; the sky faded from a pale gold<br />
  directly overhead to a curious yellow-green at the horizon.  It<br />
  reminded her of the patina found in the folds of old bronze statues.<br />
  The sounds of dozens of different languages overlaid and formed<br />
  counterpoint to the squeaks, pops, mellifluous surging chords and<br />
  crashes of alien music.  The air pressure seemed a bit higher than<br />
  earth's; the gravity a bit less.  There was definitely a higher<br />
  oxygen content in the air, and she felt giddy as she danced down the<br />
  exit ramp, resisting the temptation to swing her mesh clothes-bag.<br />
  The cat-like xenoform raced past her on all fours, yowling as if its<br />
  tail were on fire, and vanished into the crowd of Parkry who were<br />
  rushing to get on board the ship.  She ploughed a furrow through them<br />
  and made her way to the customs hut, a pale blue geodesic dome with<br />
  three triangular archways cut into it.  Her giddiness was tempered by<br />
  the sight of dozens of tall Plateau Bythians casually lounging around<br />
  the ExPort, all of them toting dull grey plastic weapons.  She<br />
  entered the dome, and felt the itchy tickling feeling that<br />
  accompanied mass-spectronometric scanning as she passed through the<br />
  doorway.  No immediately obvious alarms went off, so she assumed that<br />
  the devices she posessed were within current NoSan'No'Os levels of<br />
  acceptability.  She'd heard nasty stories of people who had tried to<br />
  commute just before the last Purge, when the standard of Interdicted<br />
  technology had been dropped while they were carrying things like<br />
  empathic personality emulators and nano-gated NeuralNet arrays.<br />
  She set her translator to `NoSan'No'Os Tertiary', the language used<br />
  to communicate with subject races (of which humanity was one), and<br />
  entered the dome.  There was a queue, but it was leading in the other<br />
  direction, from the other side of the ExPort and into the ship.  A<br />
  smaller-than-average Parkry was propped next to a data-post, holding<br />
  a vocoder hand-set and waving at her.  She went over and sat before<br />
  the xenoform, crossing her legs.  The Parkry massaged the hand-set,<br />
  and the data-post said something in Tertiary.  Her notepad's<br />
  translator responded immediately:<br />
  `Query: Full Name.  Origin.  Purpose for visit.'<br />
  `Kelanie A'liiya Camden, Earth, Diplomatic Exchange.'  At this, the<br />
  Parkry glanced over from the holographic output from the data-post.<br />
  It squeezed the hand-set, keeping its glittering eyes on her.  More<br />
  Tertiary.<br />
  `Expression of interest, your reference: Diplomatic Exchange.<br />
  Query: Which Bureau.&quot;  She sighed, safe in the knowledge that the<br />
  translator would ignore it, and replied,<br />
  `Bureau of Procuration.'  The Parkry seemed to lose interest.  It<br />
  gave her a plastic bracelet, studded with a pattern of metallic dots,<br />
  and the data-post played a recorded message, in flat, unaccented<br />
  Anglic:<br />
  `This clothing is your identification while you are staying on<br />
  Millimillenary.   Do not lose it, sell it or exchange it for<br />
  interdicted technology.  You will not be allowed to leave the planet<br />
  without it.  It is resistant to all chemicals and temperatures above'<br />
  (here, the post made a sound like a poorly-tuned radio), `and below'<br />
  (a sound like a bass-pitched dog's whine).  `Please note: it is not<br />
  resistant to thermonuclear, fusion or ComonCurensy isotope detonation<br />
  above the thirty megaton range.  Put it on now.'  The Parkry was<br />
  watching her again, so she wrapped it around her left wrist and<br />
  pressed the ends together, which melded to form a single piece.<br />
  `This clothing can only be removed by an authorised agent of the<br />
  NoSan'No'Os, on your departure from Millimillenary.'  The interview<br />
  appeared to be over.  She stood up, and wandered towards an exit,<br />
  where small groups of Parkry were still queueing for departure<br />
  processing.  She fished the video-eyepiece (which she had not used<br />
  since she last visited Japan) from a pouch in her bag and put on the<br />
  headband, the eyepiece hanging over her left eye like a pirate's<br />
  eyepatch.  It made a tiny `peep' noise as it matched carriers with<br />
  her notepad, and the view through the eyepiece blurred momentarily.<br />
  One by one, as the processor in her notepad identified and translated<br />
  them, various signs written in Tertiary were marked and translations<br />
  were appended in the eyepiece's view.  She spotted a data-post marked<br />
  `Free Information for the Newcomer' and went over to it.  She spoke<br />
  to her notepad;<br />
  `Excuse me?  I need information.'  The data-post made pretty<br />
  holographic moire patterns to indicate that it was thinking, and then<br />
  replied, in Anglic,<br />
  `Please be more specific.'<br />
  `I need to locate food, water and a place to sleep.  I also need to<br />
  locate other humans on Millimillenary, if there are any.'  Another<br />
  pause, more moire-patterns, and then,<br />
  `Food and water for humans can be obtained from the Human Embassy,<br />
  at LFFRE-77153.  No information regarding requirements for,' and it<br />
  quoted her words, playing a sample of her saying &quot;a place to sleep&quot;,<br />
  `is available.  You will find other humans at the Embassy.'  It<br />
  displayed a map (which looked like it might have been designed by<br />
  Piet Mondrian).  Her notepad translated the text, and if she was any<br />
  judge of distance, the Embassy appeared to be about seven hundred<br />
  kilometres away from the ExPort.<br />
  `Are there any places matching my requirements, closer to the<br />
  ExPort?  If so, please list the five closest, and the distance to<br />
  them.'  Another pause, and then:<br />
  `There are three.  &quot;Maracite Information Exchange Registry&quot;,<br />
  LFFRB-77151, six hundred and ninety-three blocks from here to there,<br />
  &quot;Church of the SubGenius&quot;, LLFRB-77122, six hundred and fifty-one<br />
  blocks from here to there,' - another pause - '&quot;Waddell's Emporium of<br />
  Extremely Fashionable Attire and Quite Nice Ice Cream Parlour&quot;,<br />
  NRNAL-10021, two blocks from here to there.'  These three were<br />
  represented by tiny red inverted `A's on the map, two of them close<br />
  to the Embassy, the ice-cream parlour so close to the ExPort that it<br />
  appeared almost to be on the same block.  She took a snapshot of the<br />
  map with her notepad, expanded it until she could see enough details<br />
  to find the ice-cream parlour and left the dome.<br />
  Millimillenary appeared to be completely covered by city-scape, the<br />
  entire habitable surface of the planet divided up into a grid, with<br />
  buildings that reached up for about fifty storeys, providing a third<br />
  dimension that the map wasn't required to show.  The streets were<br />
  based in pale concrete, paved with slippery white ceramic plates, and<br />
  would have been rather drab and utilitarian if it wasn't for the<br />
  hundreds of different xenoforms who streamed up and down them.  There<br />
  appeared to be a large single lane of foot-traffic (or at least what<br />
  passed for feet on some beings) moving in one direction, and two<br />
  smaller lanes on either side, moving in the other direction.  This<br />
  tended to work to the disadvantage of the sentients who were on the<br />
  outside lanes, and it became apparent that it was often easier to<br />
  travel three or four blocks out of your way, just to use the quicker<br />
  inner lane.  In places, she saw what appeared to be short grey trees,<br />
  bare of leaves, the branches dividing into three from the base,<br />
  progressively sub-dividing to a mass of thread-like tips.  She<br />
  reached out to stroke a branch which was about the thickness of her<br />
  little finger, and it writhed away from her touch.<br />
  Waddell's shop occupied the entire ground floor of one block; the<br />
  outside was a mass of holographic signs in dozens of languages,<br />
  including Anglic, Russic Europan and Katakana.  There were beeps,<br />
  squeaks and hums that she recognised as signs for xenoforms that<br />
  didn't have a visual sense.  She spent a few minutes looking for a<br />
  door, found one (concealed within a hologram of a two-metre-tall<br />
  chocolate sundae - her mouth was watering already) and entered.<br />
  The ice-cream parlour was located in the centre of the store, with<br />
  the clothing displays surrounding it.  The clothes looked like<br />
  theatrical costumes - surely, no-one wore Elizabethan ruffs these<br />
  days!  She began to think that this store catered more for xenoforms<br />
  who wanted to dress up than for actual humans.  She wondered why she<br />
  hadn't thought to ask the data-post at the ExPort exactly how many<br />
  humans there were on Millimillenary.  At least the music was<br />
  terrestrial - early Robert Smith.<br />
  There was a dejected-looking young man with short dark hair sitting<br />
  behind the counter.  He was cleaning a small metal part from a<br />
  blender that was disassembled around him.  A xeno that resembled a<br />
  metre-tall kiwi-bird hopped up on to the counter and said,<br />
  `Reeee? Reeeeeeee?'  He took a glazed cherry from a bowl nearby and<br />
  tossed it to the xeno, which caught it with the end of its long,<br />
  flexible snout and jumped off.  She approached the counter, and with<br />
  an audible `click', turned off her notepad.  The young man froze.<br />
  `Excuse me, i'd like to order a chocolate s-' he looked up, and<br />
  almost fell off the stool he was perched on.  He leaped off the<br />
  stool, dropping the part he was cleaning, rushed over and grabbed her<br />
  shoulders.   He stared into her face with a disturbing intensity.<br />
  `Are... are you a human?'  He was trembling.<br />
  `Yes... why?  You seem rather upset.'  His eyes grew wide, and a<br />
  look of hysterical disbelief appeared.<br />
  `Upset... upset, she says.  My god!  You are only the third human<br />
  being that I have seen in seven years! UPSET!!!' he began to laugh<br />
  hysterically.  She broke free from his grasp, and grabbed him by the<br />
  front of his shirt.  He kept laughing, eyes squeezed shut, and she<br />
  was obliged to slap him.  He stopped abruptly, gasping, face almost<br />
  white except for a red palm-print, staring at her in shock.  `I'm<br />
  sorry.'  he whispered, turning and stumbling back to the counter,<br />
  picking up the polishing-rag as he went.  It was then that she<br />
  noticed a chain bolted around his ankle.  She rushed after him,<br />
  catching his arm and spinning him around to face her again.  He<br />
  refused to meet her gaze, so she took his chin in her hand and lifted<br />
  his face.  He closed his eyes and tried to struggle free.  She threw<br />
  her arm around his shoulder, drew him close and pressed her lips to<br />
  his.  After a moment's hesitation, he responded, returning her<br />
  attention hungrily.  His hands slipped around her waist, hugging her<br />
  to him intently, slowly forcing her back onto the counter.  She let<br />
  him proceed, wondering what sort of circumstance could put someone in<br />
  a position where he had to live apart from his own people for so<br />
  long.<br />
  She got the story out of him eventually.  His name was Marek, and<br />
  his great-grandparents had started this venture out, just over a<br />
  hundred years ago, when the NRNAL-10021 district was still under<br />
  development.  As the district became less local- and more tourist-<br />
  oriented, the business prospered to the point where they owned the<br />
  entire block, right up to the fiftieth floor; at this point, they had<br />
  attracted the attention of a sub-set of the Parkry, who demanded a<br />
  cut of the profits.  When Marek's grandparents had refused, they had<br />
  been denounced to the NoSan'No'Os as possible technocrats, in the<br />
  employ of the Interdicted Moridani, and had been banished.  Marek's<br />
  parents, too young to join his grandparents in exile,  had been<br />
  indentured to a local Information Trader, who had taken over the<br />
  business (after assuring the Parkry that they would get their cut).<br />
  `... which, as I rapidly learned, was the way things were done<br />
  around here.  Still are, in fact.'  Marek fell silent.  Kelanie<br />
  hugged him again.<br />
  `What I can't understand is they would put you into such menial,<br />
  mind-numbing labour as this, when you would be more useful to them in<br />
  an -' he glanced up at her.<br />
  `- administrative position?' He scowled.  `Kelanie, this entire<br />
  planet is knee-deep in bureaucrats.  I could spend several lifetimes<br />
  here, gradually moving up the ranks, and one day, maybe, MAYBE, I<br />
  would get to a position where I could filch a packet of blank memory<br />
  cartridges.  Maybe.'  Kelanie was silent.  Marek hadn't yet realised<br />
  how high up in the structure her position was.<br />
  There was an awkward pause, during which Marek absently polished an<br />
  already-gleaming spoon.  Kelanie's stomach broke the silence with the<br />
  sort of gurgle you'd get from not eating for three days.  She glanced<br />
  longingly at the array of ice-cream-like substances; Marek glanced at<br />
  her apologetically, and then rushed to prepare a `Waddell Special'<br />
  for her.<br />
  After sharing the large sundae with him, she asked if there was<br />
  somewhere she could sleep, and Marek pointed to a pile of hessian-<br />
  like sacks in an alcove, evidently his home.  The chain from his leg<br />
  was fixed to a point next to a small wash-trough from which water<br />
  gurgled quietly.  There were a few holograms pasted on the wall, and<br />
  a small audio player.  She took him by the hand and led him over to<br />
  his bed.</p>

<p> `If that's the way it looks, then it probably is, but I<br />
  would be tempted to take it apart anyway, just to be<br />
  sure.'</p>

<p> She woke a few hours later, with a sore throat from the sharp<br />
  oxygen-rich air.  Marek was hugging her as if he were afraid that<br />
  she'd escape.  She idly stroked his cheek, smiling.  It wasn't often<br />
  that she had the time, or the inclination, for such recreational<br />
  activity in her position.  The intensity of the emotion Marek had<br />
  revealed after his isolation touched her deeply, and she began<br />
  turning various schemes around in her mind, with a view to releasing<br />
  him from his servitude.<br />
  Marek noticed the bracelet she had received at the Millimillenary<br />
  ExPort.<br />
  `What did you do to deserve that?'<br />
  `The Parkry at the ExPort gave it to me when I arrived... what do<br />
  you mean, &quot;deserve it&quot;?  Marek stroked the pattern of raised metallic<br />
  dots.<br />
  `It looks like the markers that the NoSan'No'Os place on crates of<br />
  interdicted technology... I think it's an identifier for possible<br />
  criminal activity, sort of like a warning... it means that if you<br />
  were arrested, you'd be taken to the Office of Threat Termination<br />
  immediately, no questions asked.'<br />
  `Threat Termination?  That sounds a bit extr-' Suddenly, a voice,<br />
  speaking in Anglic, called out from the main counter.<br />
  `Waiter?  Way-y-te-r-r!!!!'  She was mildly surprised to recognise<br />
  the voice - it belonged to a pre-millennium video actor, Rik Mayall.<br />
  She turned over, and peered at the counter.  She couldn't see<br />
  anything there, but the voice called out again, in exactly the same<br />
  tones.  She suspected that it was being generated by a digital<br />
  sampler.  She got up, draped some loose bedding material around her<br />
  shoulders, but after realising that there were very few xenoforms on<br />
  Millimillenary that would be offended by a naked human, she draped<br />
  the cloth over Marek instead and went over to the counter, taking her<br />
  notepad just in case `waiter, waiter' was the alien's complete Anglic<br />
  vocabulary.  Looking over the counter, she saw something like a<br />
  swollen turtle shell, almost two metres long and a metre tall.  She<br />
  could see her reflection in the smooth, glossy black surface; the<br />
  shell was completely featureless, not even a sign of feet, wheels or<br />
  other methods of propulsion - it seemed to slide along the ground by<br />
  sheer willpower.  She felt a faint tickling sensation behind her<br />
  breastbone as the xeno turned to face her, probably caused by some<br />
  sort of sonar-based sense.  The xeno spoke again, employing another<br />
  audio sample, a very old one judging from the degree of noise that<br />
  accompanied it:<br />
  `Where's our fish?  We've finished our fish!'  Kelanie was paging<br />
  through her notepad's Species ID files, which had been greatly<br />
  augmented by access to the local data service; this alien lacked a<br />
  name that could be easily represented in human terms, and was simply<br />
  denoted by the code `N-SVW-Tre/A'.  There was a Tertiary language<br />
  interface available, so she patched it in and spoke to it.<br />
  `How may I serve you?'  The notepad converted her expression to<br />
  Tertiary, and from there to N-SVW-Tre/A, which sounded like a wavery<br />
  cockatoo screech which rose in volume and then faded again.<br />
  Apparently, the N-SVW-Tre/A's natural communication took place on a<br />
  frequency higher than human hearing, because the translator returned<br />
  its response after a short pause, during which all Kelanie heard was<br />
  the faint jingling and crashing of the music.<br />
  `I had thought you incapable of sarcasm, Marek.  (carriage return<br />
  line feed).  Have you been taking lessons behind my back? (carriage<br />
  return line feed).  And from which of our worthy customers did you<br />
  steal that instrument?  (carriage return line feed).  I believe that<br />
  it is high on the NoSan'No'Os Interdiction list, if it is what it<br />
  appears to be, and if you continue to point it at me, I will have you<br />
  beaten.  (end of file).'<br />
  What an asshole, (carriage return line feed), Kelanie thought.<br />
  Marek rushed up, pulling on a pair of pants, and threw himself down<br />
  in front of the xeno, kneeling, arms thrust back, forehead almost<br />
  touching the floor.  Acting on instinct, Kelanie started a<br />
  holographic recording, sure that Marek's employer was about to give a<br />
  graphic example of how poorly it treated him.  The tickling feeling<br />
  wavered, as if the xeno was having trouble distinguishing between<br />
  them; it finally oriented towards Marek, edged closer to him and<br />
  suddenly lashed out with a club-like flipper, hitting Marek on the<br />
  side of the head and almost knocking him down.  Kelanie watched,<br />
  restraining herself; the holographic recording clearly showed blood<br />
  running from a deep scratch on Marek's forehead.  The xeno turned to<br />
  leave, and Kelanie nodded, stopping the recording.  After finding a<br />
  particularly cutting insult in the N-SVW-Tre/A's relation-table, she<br />
  stepped over and delivered a solid kick to the rear end of the xeno's<br />
  shell, pushing the alien across the floor into a cluster of<br />
  hat-stands, one of which fell over.  The xeno shuddered like a<br />
  stalled motor-vehicle for a moment, and then seemed to regain its<br />
  composure, turning to face her like an armoured tank.  She felt the<br />
  tickling feeling definitely as the blank curved turtle shape surged<br />
  towards her.  Marek grabbed her arm and whispered,<br />
  `Come on, don't make things any worse than they -' She held out her<br />
  notepad and thumbed the `Send' key.  It gave out a short screech that<br />
  stopped the N-SVW-Tre/A in its tracks.  There was a moment of<br />
  silence, during which even the background music seemed to quieten.<br />
  Kelanie felt the tickling feeling waver as the xeno hesitantly looked<br />
  her over.  It hissed, and her notepad translated.<br />
  `Confirm. (carriage return line feed)'  She smiled grimly, typed<br />
  her response, sent the translation.  It was so quiet that she could<br />
  hear Marek breathing behind her.  The xeno's response must have been<br />
  highly emotional, as it was carried on a sound-wave that was well in<br />
  the supersonic range... the translator caught it, though:<br />
  `Such transactions are not covered by NoSan'No'Os Code. (carriage<br />
  return line feed).  You must offer a minimum amount to allow a tax to<br />
  be levied on the exchange. (end of file).'  She popped a dull<br />
  metallic sphere out of plastic bubble-pack she had been given at the<br />
  Earth ExPort, and tossed it to the floor in front of the xeno, which<br />
  scrambled after it and then turned to leave.  As it trundled away,<br />
  she felt the tickling feeling intensify, almost to the point of an<br />
  ache, which suddenly cut off as the N-SVW-Tre/A passed through the<br />
  exit.<br />
  `Marek?' He had vanished.  She followed the chain that had looped<br />
  around one of the stools mounted behind the counter, and led to the<br />
  Millimillenarian equivalent of a broom cupboard.  Marek was crouched<br />
  inside, with a piece of recycled hessian paper-cloth pressed against<br />
  the cut on his forehead, his eyes squeezed shut.  `Marek, you can<br />
  come out now.  It's safe.'<br />
  `He's going to kill me.  He's going to come back and kill me and<br />
  cut me up and feed the pieces to his children.  He said that he'd do<br />
  that one day if I ever got out of line.'  Kelanie knelt down next to<br />
  Marek, putting her arms around him.<br />
  `He won't.  He can't, because I bought you from him.  In fact, I<br />
  bought the whole enterprise.'  Marek opened his eyes and stared at<br />
  her.<br />
  `You couldn't have.  I doubt that anyone on Earth has enough money<br />
  to buy this property - what did you say to him?'<br />
  `I reminded him of a sub-section of the NoSan'No'Os Code, the part<br />
  regarding proper treatment of equipment and subject races, and I told<br />
  him that if the InterSpecies Advisory group saw this recording I'd<br />
  made, that he and his entire species could be deported as a possible<br />
  `Risk Of Violent Species' classification.  I then offered my word as<br />
  &quot;a Human&quot; that I'd erase the recording if he sold you to me... and he<br />
  couldn't sell you unless he sold the shop as well. Marek's face fell<br />
  slightly.<br />
  `So, you're my owner now.'<br />
  `No!  I'm not even your employer - bureau associates aren't allowed<br />
  to have anything to do with the private sector.  I'll have to sign<br />
  the entire thing over to you.'  She smiled.  Marek got up.<br />
  `First thing we have to do, is sell it.  My master - my old master-<br />
  is probably off right now to find some mercenary Pthalklin Ervae that<br />
  he can pay to torch the place, that's the way their minds work...  I<br />
  know a few factors who'd be interested in this property.'  He moved<br />
  over to the telephone, keyed the contact panel.  Some words appeared<br />
  in angular Tertiary script, which her eyepiece translated as `Finding<br />
  Free Data Channel: Please Wait'.  They waited, Marek tapping his<br />
  fingers impatiently on the console.  More letters appeared on the<br />
  screen:</p>
<p> While You &lt;approx&gt; Are Waiting:  Concern &lt;approx&gt; is<br />
  experienced by your government's Technological Control<br />
  Bureau when rumors/unconfirmed reports &lt;approx&gt; appear,<br />
  indicating that the Technological Interdict is not being<br />
  taken seriously &lt;approx&gt;.  Remember: only you &lt;approx&gt; can<br />
  prevent thermonuclear devastation on a wide scale.</p>
<p> Kelanie was incredulous.<br />
  `Government propaganda!  They never stop, do they... I wonder how<br />
  the NoSan'No'Os Bureaucracy has managed to stay together for this<br />
  long... I thought that bureaucracy was one of the least inherently<br />
  stable forms of government.'  Suddenly, the telephone screen cleared,<br />
  and a voice spoke in Anglic:<br />
  `Human Bureaucracy is inherently unstable.  NoSan'No'Os Bureaucracy<br />
  is not founded on greed and the inherently human sense of blind<br />
  self-importance.  This message was brought to you by the office of<br />
  Millimillenarian Technological Control.'  Marek smiled at this, and<br />
  when he caught Kelanie giving him a quizzical look, he said,<br />
  `They're always listening... it's just as well you didn't say<br />
  anything really inflammatory, otherwise,' (the 'phone pinged, and the<br />
  `call open' message flashed up) `those Ervae that my ex-master is<br />
  hiring would find a big hole in the ground here when they came to<br />
  torch the shop.  Anyway, your call is always put through just after<br />
  one of those little messages... you just have to be careful that you<br />
  don't say something too inflammatory.'  Marek addressed the telephone<br />
  in flawless Tertiary, and a bizarre psychedelic pattern appeared on<br />
  the screen, oscillating and flashing through hundreds of glowing<br />
  colours.  Kelanie got the impression of two twisted toroids<br />
  intertwined in mid-air.  Marek asked,<br />
  `Keery?  Nur-wah Marek, Keery!' Whatever-it-was chattered in<br />
  hollow-sounding, oddly-modulated Tertiary, to which Marek rapidly<br />
  replied, speaking over the translation that Kelanie's notepad<br />
  supplied, going too fast for it to keep up.  The thing pulsed bright<br />
  green three times; Marek held up five fingers; it pulsed blue-green<br />
  four times; Marek held up four fingers with his thumb bent over; the<br />
  thing flashed orange, red and a piercing hot pink colour, and the<br />
  image disappeared as it broke the connection.  Marek stood there for<br />
  a few moments, eyes wide, a faint smile on his face.  Kelanie left<br />
  off fiddling with the notepad's playback, and asked him,<br />
  `Keery?'<br />
  `Kireedeonibalikathadamiax.'<br />
  `Well? Did you sell it? How much did you get for it?' When he<br />
  didn't answer, she nudged him and repeated the question.<br />
  `Oh?  Yeah, she bought it...' He went over to the counter and<br />
  started rummaging around underneath, looking for something.  She<br />
  moved over to join him, shifting boxes as he dragged them out from<br />
  underneath the counter.<br />
  `Well?  Come on, Marek, don't be a tease - how much?'  Marek found<br />
  what he was looking for - a spherical yellow-glass bottle filled with<br />
  clear brown fluid - popped the cap off took a long swig and said:<br />
  `Four and one half CCi.'  He suddenly sat on the floor, grimacing<br />
  at the taste of the fluid.<br />
  `CCi?'<br />
  `ComonCurensy Isotope.  It's the official medium of exchange on all<br />
  the NoSan'No'Os Civilised Systems - don't you know anything?'<br />
  `Well, apparently, the NoSan'No'Os don't consider Earth civilised<br />
  yet... that's the first I've ever heard of - what was it?' Marek got<br />
  up, went over to the platform-cash register mounted into the counter,<br />
  and retrieved a note from the cash tray.  He held it out to her.<br />
  `ComonCurensy Isotope.  It's a form of sheet-carbon TCI, in an-'<br />
  `TCI?'<br />
  `Total Conversion Isotope, in an easy-to-fuse format; the<br />
  NoSan'No'Os are generally energy-based when it comes to currency.<br />
  Earth is still trying to make information-based currency work, aren't<br />
  they?'  She nodded, examining the note.<br />
  `We may be locked into the idea of an economy based on barter, but<br />
  at least we don't use this sort of thing anymore.'  She held out her<br />
  wrist, revealing the silver button contact of her Work-Credit- Hour<br />
  meter.  Marek took back the note, replacing it in the till from force<br />
  of habit.<br />
  `This is the largest bill we have - that's a &quot;Five by ten to the<br />
  power of minus twelve&quot; CCi note.'  He noted her expression, and<br />
  grinned.  `Yeah... I remember once that the entire human solar system<br />
  - all the planets and their resources - was once priced at twenty<br />
  CCi.'  Kelanie tried to compare that to a recent estimate of the<br />
  solar system's worth in Human terms, and gave up, settling for the<br />
  approximation that Marek was probably richer than anyone she'd ever<br />
  met before - in fact, richer than anyone on Earth.</p>
<p> *           *           *           *           *</p>
<p> `...and you've never seen one?'<br />
  `I don't think so, no... all I have is the name: &quot;Tendeysharhi&quot;,<br />
  and the Species ID N-FRF-Bla/G.  Mind you, I haven't had a really<br />
  good look through the local data service yet - I find myself<br />
  continually interrupted...' she smiled at him.  They were exploring<br />
  the city, looking for somewhere to stay while Kelanie completed her<br />
  mission.  This was the first time Marek had been outside the shop<br />
  since his indenture, sixteen years ago, and he was just as bewildered<br />
  as she.  They had followed the grid pattern until they came up<br />
  against a huge, blank curved wall which cut smoothly through the<br />
  streets and buildings.  They had back-tracked around the blocks,<br />
  coming up against this wall each time, and had made no progress for<br />
  about an hour when they decided to stop at something resembling a<br />
  street cafe and sort out their next move.<br />
  Marek ordered iced tea (the only terrestrial thing on the `Seff<br />
  Cafe' menu) while Kelanie tried to sort out the indexing system used<br />
  by the local data service.<br />
  `This is strange, it's like a binary tree, but it has branches<br />
  going both ways...'  Kelanie gave up looking for a map that she could<br />
  understand without requiring severe modifications to the structure of<br />
  her brain, and started tracing N-FRF-Bla/G in the Species ID section.<br />
  She found it, right next to &quot;N-FRF-Knh/K&quot; - which was the code for<br />
  Humanity; it was that cat-like alien she had met onboard the<br />
  NoSan'No'Os transport.<br />
  `Crash it,' she murmured, `that xeno could have been the one I was<br />
  supposed to meet.'  Something had come over to them and was trying to<br />
  communicate, tweaking its translator.  It had a small, rounded body<br />
  perched on long, stilt-like legs, a pair of small hands held up in<br />
  front like a kangaroo's; a large domed head with four tiny red eyes<br />
  set more or less evenly at the front, a wide, lipless grinning mouth,<br />
  and no neck.  Its translator said something, some of which Kelanie's<br />
  notepad could understand: &quot;Undefined - Undefined - Haircut? -<br />
  Undefined.&quot;  She grinned at Marek.  `A Xenoform barber! Do you think<br />
  I need a haircut?'  The alien bent at the knees, bowing and smirking.<br />
  Marek was earnestly trying to help the xenoform fine-tune its<br />
  translator when Kelanie spotted a familiar feline form slinking into<br />
  a building across the street.  She grabbed Marek's arm excitedly,<br />
  dragging him away from the cafeteria and the dome-headed xeno.  She<br />
  pressed up against the clear plastic of the office-space across the<br />
  road from the cafeteria, just as a massive explosion rocked the<br />
  street, pieces of debris from the cafe clattering against the<br />
  sheet-plastic next to them.  There was a brief space of silence,<br />
  followed by a wierd cacophony of alien moans and hoots of distress.<br />
  The air was soon thick with the buzz and click of translators,<br />
  overlaid with tinkling bell-like tones - sirens that signalled the<br />
  arrival of the Bythian Militia who were soon swarming over the site<br />
  like insects from a hive that had been attacked.   Kelanie spotted<br />
  the barber striding away on its improbably long legs, tucking<br />
  something into a spherical satchel.  She dragged Marek into the<br />
  office-space, glancing about for a doorway out of the front-<br />
  desk/screening area that the feline xeno could have taken.<br />
  A datapost was mounted into what passed for an enquiries desk.<br />
  Kelanie approached it, tugging Marek (who was still trying to see<br />
  what was going on across the street) with her.<br />
  `Where are we?' she asked the datapost, which displayed the usual<br />
  &quot;please wait while I translate that&quot; moire, and then said -<br />
  surprisingly, in Anglic:<br />
  `Kelanie A'liiya Camden?  You had an appointment with Ambassador<br />
  Aouwwrr'lrr-Interface-to-the-Enemy this morning.  She is in at the<br />
  moment if you would like to reschedule that appointment.'  Kelanie<br />
  was surprised for a moment, and then said,<br />
  `Yes... of course.  Why wasn't I notified of the meeting?'  The<br />
  datapost chewed this over for a few moments, and said,<br />
  `Evidence points towards a Matter of Pride, between members of the<br />
  Tendeysharh Embassy Staff, because you shared a berth on a<br />
  NoSan'No'Os Transport with Ambassador Aouwwrr'lrr-<br />
  Interface-to-the-Enemy's mate.  Impropriety was assumed.'  Kelanie<br />
  frowned.<br />
  `I didn't touch it.  Him, whatever!  In fact, I deliberately slept<br />
  outside the-' she was cut off by a protracted yowl, which was<br />
  translated by the datapost and Kelanie's notepad simultaneously.<br />
  `Exactly!   Wasn't my mate good enough for you?'  Kelanie turned to<br />
  see the feline xeno that she had spotted from the cafe.  She<br />
  (assuming it was a `she') was similar in form to the Tendeysharhi<br />
  she'd shared the berth with on the NoSan'No'Os transport; slightly<br />
  shorter (almost the same height as Kelanie herself); different<br />
  markings, a much furrier tail, and what appeared to be an elaborate<br />
  gold necklace which, on closer examination, proved to be a<br />
  NoSan'No'Os ExoManipulator, a second set of small mechanical hands<br />
  which could be worn around the neck.  Many races here wore them,<br />
  particularly those which had poor substitutes for hands, without<br />
  opposable thumbs.<br />
  `I was supposed to contact one of your staff with regard to<br />
  detailed information about the correct approach to - ' Kelanie began,<br />
  and was cut off again by the Tendeysharhi.<br />
  `Yes- that is me.  While this gesture is largely symbolic, it is<br />
  nonetheless important that it be performed properly.  Follow me.' The<br />
  feline xeno glanced at Marek.  `That... can wait outside.' Kelanie<br />
  glanced at Marek, smiled, and said,<br />
  `This is Marek Waddell, one-time owner of-' she was cut off yet<br />
  again - Tendeysharhi seemed to like doing that - as Mrrr'lrr's mate<br />
  mewed, flattening her ears, her tail lashing back and forth.<br />
  `I have heard of you.  We put in a bid for that property, and were<br />
  out-priced by &quot;Keery&quot;...' her eyes narrowed to emerald slits, and she<br />
  growled, `Can you think of any reason why I should not attack you<br />
  right now?'  Marek grinned and replied,<br />
  `Only that the property isn't worth anything like what Keery paid<br />
  for it - the previous owner is going to have it burned to the<br />
  ground... if it hasn't happened already...' He paused in thought.<br />
  Kelanie was thinking along similar lines.<br />
  `Do you think the explosion in the cafe was an attempt on us by<br />
  your N-SVW-Tre/A?'  Marek shook his head.<br />
  `They only hire Pthalklin Ervae for that sort of thing - they have<br />
  one of those ninety-year contracts for mercenary work.  If I can use<br />
  your data service for half an hour,'  Marek said to Aouwwrr'lrr, `I<br />
  think I can bribe some Parkry and learn something.'  Ambassador<br />
  Aouwwrr'lrr lashed her tail in a gesture of assent, took Kelanie by<br />
  the hand and said,<br />
  `Meanwhile, I will instruct your mate in our customs.'</p>
<p> She led Kelanie to a Tendeysharhi conference room, something like a<br />
  large tree turned inside-out; branches as thick as Kelanie's waist<br />
  emerged from one wall, crossed the room and entered the other.  The<br />
  light in here was a dim blue-green, from bioluminescent strips<br />
  embedded in the domed ceiling.  Aouwwrr'lrr perched on a branch about<br />
  three metres from the ground, with her chin resting on her paws, and<br />
  regarded Kelanie with calm, feline intent.  She mewed softly, her<br />
  expression tinged with soft purring trills, and Kelanie's translator<br />
  offered:<br />
  `I am a student of Primate Psychology.  I have been a student of<br />
  Primate Psychology for six (years), and yet I must confess that I<br />
  cannot understand humans.'  Kelanie sat on a branch below Aouwwrr'lrr<br />
  and replied,<br />
  `Feel free to ask me anything.  My position requires a knowledge<br />
  of, ah, primate psychology.' Aouwwrr'lrr's tail flicked once, and she<br />
  said,<br />
  `I believe that you came here without being given much<br />
  justification from your superiors.  Correct?'<br />
  `Yes...'<br />
  `Don't you feel a need to question that?  Don't you want to know<br />
  _why_ you've been sent here?'  Kelanie thought for a moment, climbed<br />
  up to sit with her back against the bole of a tree set into one wall,<br />
  then said,<br />
  `No, I don't.  Most people who work for a government agency - well,<br />
  most people at my level - are used to accepting unusual orders and<br />
  not questioning them.  The world we work in - even, as we are,<br />
  occupied by the NoSan'No'Os and with most of the difficult decisions<br />
  a government usually faces, taken from them - is very complex, and no<br />
  one person could be expected to grasp more than a facet of the whole<br />
  thing.'  Aouwwrr'lrr narrowed her eyes.  Her translator said:<br />
  `... and yet someone in the NoSan'No'Os manages this task.  Some<br />
  single entity somewhere must know exactly what is going on.'  Kelanie<br />
  suddenly began to have some doubts about this mission.  She recalled<br />
  something Robyn had once told her: that in some conversations, the<br />
  topics were delineated more by what was avoided than what was<br />
  discussed.  She recalled that the Tendeysharhi had once been a<br />
  subject race of the Moridani, who were the dedicated enemy of the<br />
  NoSan'No'Os.  She turned to frame a very pointed question, but was<br />
  surprised by a heavy thump as Aouwwrr'lrr leaped down to land next to<br />
  her on the branch.  Aouwwrr'lrr held up her paw, claws fully<br />
  extended, and said, awkwardly, in Anglic:<br />
  `Race like Tendeysharhi, always listen to by 'San'No'Os.  Careful,<br />
  when you say into translator, of what you will say.'  Kelanie was<br />
  silent for a moment, then said,<br />
  `Tell me how your mate would like to be approached for this<br />
  occasion.'  They settled down to business, discussing the<br />
  Tendeysharhi sexual mores and customs.  Kelanie resolved to<br />
  investigate this matter further.</p>

  Pray tell me Sir, whose dog are you?'</p>
<p> Alexander Pope, 1730</p>
<p> Marek was busily applying skills he had picked up from a childhood<br />
  spent on a world ruled by the innately bureaucratic Parkry; he was<br />
  dealing favors.<br />
  `The person at this end is waiting for an opening to appear so that<br />
  the person can put forward a proposal.'  he said in Tertiary.  The<br />
  lower-level Parkry official he had found to bribe manipulated a data<br />
  hand-set, and the reply was spelled out on the screen:<br />
  THE PERSON AT THIS END OWES YOU NO FAVORS BUT WOULD BE INTERESTED<br />
  IN ENTERING THAT STATE - ON THE CONDITION THAT ANY RISK OR INNOVATION<br />
  COULD BE MINIMISED.  Marek smiled.  He had never met a Parkry that<br />
  wouldn't take a bribe - if it could be assured that there was little<br />
  chance of being caught.<br />
  `The person at this end, by way of introducing the proposal, wishes<br />
  it to be known that it is of Human Origin; that it is proud of its<br />
  Human capabilities; that Humanity is seeking to better itself through<br />
  becoming a society that uses Information as a basis for exchange, for<br />
  currency.'<br />
  THE PERSON AT THIS END, WITH TYPICALLY SUBTLE PARKRY PERCEPTION,<br />
  PERCEIVES THE TOPIC OF THE PROPOSAL BEFORE IT IS DESCRIBED.  HOW CAN<br />
  THE PERSON AT THIS END ENRICH THE HUMAN ECONOMY?  Marek suddenly<br />
  asked, with uncharacteristic bluntness designed to shock the<br />
  bureaucrat,<br />
  `Have the Militia found the ones responsible for the attack on the<br />
  Seff Cafe?'  The Parkry hunched its shoulders in surprise.<br />
  THE PERSON AT THIS END IS NOT CLEARED FOR MATTERS RELATING TO THE<br />
  MILITIA, BUT WILL ATTEMPT TO LOCATE A PERSON THAT IS.  PLEASE WAIT.<br />
  Marek smiled again, hearing the Parkry's favourite expression.<br />
  Things had certainly moved faster when he made it clear how much<br />
  money he was willing to devote to the exercise.  The bureaucrat<br />
  reappeared, bobbing its head when it saw that Marek was still<br />
  attending.  THE PERSON AT THIS END CAN REVEAL THAT THE MATTER WAS<br />
  TAKEN OUT OF THE MILITIA'S HANDS SHORTLY AFTER IT HAPPENED.  THE<br />
  MATTER HAS BEEN REFERRED UPWARDS.<br />
  `Upwards?  From the Militia, UPWARDS?'<br />
  THE PERSON AT THIS END BELIEVES THAT THIS IS A VERY DELICATE<br />
  MATTER.  THE PERSON AT THIS END BELIEVES THAT IT MAY HAVE COMPROMISED<br />
  ITS POSITION IN FINDING THE INFORMATION THAT HAS BEEN MADE AVAILABLE.<br />
  It wanted more money.  Marek went to deposit more CCI in the famous<br />
  bank account that was officially registered to `Marissey', widely<br />
  known as the temporary holding ground for Parkry bribes, but the<br />
  bureaucrat at the other end ducked nervously, squeezing the<br />
  data-handset in haste:<br />
  THE PERSON AT THIS END HAS NOT COMMUNICATED EFFECTIVELY, AND WILL<br />
  RESORT TO HUMAN BLUNTNESS: NO MORE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE.  THIS IS<br />
  WHOLLY A MILITIA MATTER.  Marek donated two by ten to the minus<br />
  thirteenth CCI in the account anyway, after hearing this:  the<br />
  incident originated with the Militia, most likely by an agent hired<br />
  by the Militia.  He asked,<br />
  `Is it possible to speak with a Militia official?'  the Parkry<br />
  twitched its vestigal antennae; the equivalent of a sardonic chuckle.<br />
  The screen cleared and Marek found himself face to face with a<br />
  Plateau Bythian, wearing weapons and ammunition belts (even though it<br />
  was working in an office).  It regarded him from one side of its<br />
  hatchet-shaped head with obvious suspicion.  Words appeared across<br />
  the screen:<br />
  `What do you want?'  Marek lied skillfully.<br />
  `My lifetime-companion was injured today, in an explosion at a cafe<br />
  called `Seff's'.  We are concerned that such events occur in a<br />
  society as... controlled... as this one.'  The Bythian turned from<br />
  the screen for a moment; Marek could see part of a shortwave-<br />
  terminal as the Bythian searched a database; more words appeared.<br />
  `The terrorist was apprehended, an agent of the Moridani.'  Of<br />
  course.  `We have a visual:'  a window opened on the screen and a<br />
  picture appeared:  the Barber.  `Do you wish to apply for a<br />
  Government Reparation Benefit?'<br />
  `No, thank-you; the injury was minimal.'  The Bythian closed the<br />
  connection without asking if Marek wanted to know more.<br />
  Marek had never merited the attention of the Militia before; not<br />
  even his previous master had ever warranted interference at that<br />
  level.  This had to be something to do with Kelanie's mission.  Marek<br />
  decided that it would prove too expensive to probe further, also<br />
  politically unsafe.  The Parkry were bribeable; the Bythians were<br />
  not.</p>
<p> `Once more; you almost had it then.'  said Aouwwrr'lrr.  Kelanie<br />
  composed herself, put her head back and mewed:<br />
  `Aoouw?  Aooouw?'  Aouwwrr'lrr flattened her ears, lashed her tail.<br />
  `Excellent.  This should be said before the act, never during; it<br />
  is intended to indicate availability.'<br />
  `Which means that once we start, then I'm no longer available.'<br />
  Aouwwrr'lrr closed her eyes.<br />
  `Of course.'  Kelanie sat back on the branch, dangling one leg over<br />
  the edge, swinging it back and forth.  `Exactly how far is this<br />
  intended to go?  As far as consummation?' Aouwwrr'lrr mewed, flicked<br />
  her tail once in amused surprise.<br />
  `If you want.  I won't be jealous, if that's what you mean.<br />
  Tendeysharhi are used to sharing around our males.  I should caution<br />
  you, though: a detail of the male's generative organs may complicate<br />
  things.  How are Human females structured?'  Kelanie removed her<br />
  skirt.  Aouwwrr'lrr examined her, prodding her cautiously with a paw,<br />
  and then purred.  `I foresee no major problems.  Except possibly that<br />
  my mate may experience feelings of inadequacy.'</p>

<p> Marek was chatting with one of the Underground Networks' `NAPAISub'<br />
  simulators; in itself, very revealing that such a borderline-illegal<br />
  service should be available to a datapost in what was allegedly a<br />
  government office.  Ambassador Pr'rtr (Aouwwrr'lrr's mate - `it<br />
  sounds like she's purring when she talks about him', Kelanie had<br />
  said) was dividing his attention between this and toying with a<br />
  replicate-lizard, which he intended to eat eventually.  Marek faced<br />
  the datapost, addressing the NAPAISub simulator directly.<br />
  `Okay, I want you to observe this exchange, and identify it.<br />
  Understand?'  The holograph animated two spheres knocking together<br />
  twice, to indicate an answer in the affirmative.  Marek turned back<br />
  to Pr'rtr.<br />
  `Is that a real lizard?'  Pr'rtr dangled the wriggling green shape<br />
  from one paw, flicked it with his other.  His translator replied:<br />
  `Of course not.  It's a genetically-engineered plant, with built-in<br />
  reflexes that make it behave like a lizard.  What do you think we<br />
  are, savages?'  The datapost displayed a black cube that broke apart<br />
  into six pyramids and rejoined.   Marek was about to ask the datapost<br />
  to translate this when Kelanie and Aouwwrr'lrr reentered the front<br />
  office.  Kelanie took Pr'rtr's paw in her hand and led him into the<br />
  conference room.  Marek watched them, then glanced at Aouwwrr'lrr,<br />
  who flicked her tail once.  He smiled.</p>
<p> In the street, order had been restored after the bombing of the<br />
  cafe.  The only figures that weren't moving past were the two<br />
  Bythians that had been placed on sentry duty, and the Barber, who was<br />
  hiding behind the remains of a truncated pillar, listening to the<br />
  conversation in the Tendeysharhi Embassy, through the front window,<br />
  using an interferometric laser-scope.  It reached into its pouch,<br />
  withdrew a metallic ovoid, and twisted a dial at one end.  It<br />
  grinned, exposing rows of flat teeth.  A tongue like a rat's tail<br />
  flickered out and back in.<br />
  There was an ear-piercing yowl, and a large furry shape pounced on<br />
  it from somewhere above, knocking it to the ground and kicking the<br />
  grenade away.  The Tendeysharhi grabbed the Barber by some loose<br />
  clothing at the front, and slashed at the juncture of body and head<br />
  with exposed claws.   Four parallel furrows opened in the front of<br />
  the Barber, spewing forth milky-looking blood.  It writhed, tongue<br />
  lashing about madly, scrabbling for its pouch.  The Tendeysharhi<br />
  slashed at its neck again, and shuddering, the Barber died.  One of<br />
  the Bythians turned its flat head to one side, regarded them, and<br />
  turned away again.</p>

<p> Kelanie removed her clothing and sat in the matted grass that lined<br />
  the conference room floor.  Pr'rtr, perched on the branch nearest the<br />
  ground, stared at her, his head cocked to one side.  She smiled up at<br />
  him, remembering not to bare her teeth as she did so - the<br />
  Tendeysharhi would take that as a threat.  Pr'rtr lashed his tail<br />
  once.  She turned away from him, resting on her hands and knees, her<br />
  bare behind pointing at him, and mewed:<br />
  `Aoouw?'  she was surprised to hear the rhythmic hissing of<br />
  Tendeysharhi laughter.  She turned around and gave him an indignant<br />
  look.<br />
  `What's so funny?'  Pr'rtr was clutching the branch with his claws<br />
  extended to keep from falling off.  A few sibilant mews emerged.<br />
  Kelanie's notepad translated:<br />
  `That sound you made.  It's perfect, but -'<br />
  `But what?  Don't you find me attractive?'  More hisses.<br />
  `I suppose that you're quite attractive - to another human... but<br />
  you - you don't have a tail!' Pr'rtr lost his grip on the branch and<br />
  fell into a pile of leaves at the base of the conference-room tree,<br />
  landing nimbly on all fours, and then spoiling the illusion of<br />
  agility by rolling over on his back, hissing uncontrollably.  Kelanie<br />
  shifted into a sitting position and stared at him, chin on hands,<br />
  until he recovered.  Pr'rtr lay on his back, tail twitching from side<br />
  to side, arms and legs outspread.<br />
  `I'm sorry,' he said at length.  `Things have been so serious<br />
  around here lately, what with the Moridani Infiltration and all.'<br />
  Kelanie stared at him in shock.<br />
  `I beg your pardon?  Are you certain that you should be saying<br />
  things like that, being the Tendeysharhi Ambassador to the<br />
  NoSan'No'Os?'  Pr'rtr rolled over, lay on his stomach, resting his<br />
  furry chin on his paws and levelling his cool, emerald gaze at her.<br />
  `Oh, it's safe... the NoSan'No'Os never monitor me; the females of<br />
  our race are the devious ones, the ones that the NoSan'No'Os have to<br />
  be concerned about.  Us males are almost second-class citizens...<br />
  that's one thing the Moridani promised us they'd change.'  Kelanie<br />
  smiled.<br />
  `Does Aouwwrr'lrr know about this?'<br />
  `Of course!  She's a suffragette, you know.  In fact, she was<br />
  chosen by the Moridani to approach the Human Government about<br />
  permission to station a Moridani Partisan in the Human system.'<br />
  Kelanie listened to this with a growing sense of unreality.  The<br />
  Moridani were universally dreaded; it only took a hint to the<br />
  NoSan'No'Os that a Moridani might be on a planet for them to blow<br />
  that planet to pieces in a frantic attempt to destroy it.  It was<br />
  rumored that there were only twenty-three Moridani left in existence.<br />
  She became aware that Pr'rtr was sitting next to her, anxiously<br />
  tapping her on the shoulder.<br />
  `Miss Camden?'  She shook her head, sat back in the grass with her<br />
  eyes closed.<br />
  `I can't believe any of this.  It's too -'<br />
  `Too?'<br />
  ` - too extraordinary.'  Pr'rtr rubbed up against her, purring<br />
  reassuringly.  The sound relaxed her.  After a while, he said:<br />
  `It's true.  There is a Moridani Partisan hidden in our Embassy.<br />
  She uses her own - interdicted - technology to hide from the<br />
  NoSan'No'Os.  She believes that your race can be helpful to the<br />
  Moridani Cause, and so they want to station her in your solar<br />
  system.'  Kelanie sat up suddenly.<br />
  `I can't authorise something like that!  If the NoSan'No'Os find<br />
  out what's going on, they'll drop an asteroid in our sun!' Pr'rtr's<br />
  eyes opened wide, seeming to change from a brilliant emerald to aqua.<br />
  Kelanie's notepad reproduced the serious tone of Pr'rtr's words:<br />
  `She has something important to tell you.  She didn't think you'd<br />
  believe me, so she will tell you herself.  Do you think that Marek<br />
  should be present?'  The sense of unreality came back, even stronger.<br />
  `I do.  Actually, I really want someone to tell me that I'm not<br />
  dreaming.'  Unexpectedly, Pr'rtr butted his head against her<br />
  shoulder, purring.<br />
  `You aren't dreaming.'</p>
<p> *           *           *           *           *</p>
<p> Marek and Kelanie followed Pr'rtr down a spiral ramp, deep into the<br />
  basement of the Tendeysharhi embassy.  At the bottom, the blue-green<br />
  bioluminescent strips had been removed for the most part; the air was<br />
  damper and even more oxygen-rich than Millimillenarian standard.<br />
  Kelanie swallowed as her throat burned.  Pr'rtr approached a blank<br />
  wall, turned to face the two humans.<br />
  `I'm aware that you, Marek, have spent most of your life on<br />
  Millimillenary, and are familiar with unusual xenoforms; and that<br />
  you, Kelanie, work for the Bureau of Procuration, and that you are no<br />
  stranger to aliens; I want to remind you that the rumors of the<br />
  Moridani being bloodthirsty, maniacal killers are completely untrue,<br />
  despite their appearance.'  Marek replied,<br />
  `You can disregard anything you've heard about Humans taking<br />
  NoSan'No'Os propaganda literally.  We know how to listen to what a<br />
  Bureaucracy tells us.'  Pr'rtr slitted his eyes, lashed his tail and<br />
  turned back to face the blank wall.  It rippled and developed a<br />
  spiral pattern of grooves which spread out from the middle, gradually<br />
  erasing the wall until it had vanished completely.  Beyond it was<br />
  darkness; Kelanie's translator-eyepiece, viewing in the infra-red<br />
  range, outlined a massive shape at the far end of the darkened room.<br />
  She heard a soft murmuring sound, as if there were a group of people<br />
  holding a private discussion in the darkness.  Over this susurration,<br />
  a soft voice spoke in perfectly-accented Terrestrial Anglic.<br />
  `Come in, please.  My name is Tsiry-Feylen-Kendr-Tariy.'  Kelanie<br />
  stepped into the gloom with Marek following nervously behind her.<br />
  The murmuring conversations were coming from the Moridani, who<br />
  shifted slightly, giving the impression of something with the mass of<br />
  a large horse.  The voices diminished in volume until only the<br />
  occasional sibilant hiss or glottal click could be heard... with a<br />
  peculiar scraping sound underlying them.  Tsiry-Feylen-Kendr-Tariy<br />
  smoothly rose from her crouching position, revealing her full height,<br />
  and moved over to a wall; an arm flexed out from her front, touched a<br />
  contact, and as the light levels slowly increased, her form was<br />
  revealed by degrees.  Despite herself, Kelanie drew back slightly,<br />
  bumping into Marek.<br />
  She - Tsiry-Feylen - was shaped something like a six-legged<br />
  centaur; a pair of thin, double-jointed arms mounted at the front;<br />
  slick grey flesh patterned in tiny scales that glittered in the faint<br />
  light.  The attitude of the legs, the placing of the hooves and<br />
  ankles hinted at an ancestor with radial symmetry, although she had a<br />
  head at one end and a tail at the other.  Kelanie stood there,<br />
  fascinated; someone had once put forward a theory that stated that<br />
  intelligent life in the galaxy had, so far, been distinguished by<br />
  three distinct waves, of which humanity and related races were part<br />
  of the third; the Moridani would have been part of the first wave.<br />
  Tsiry-Feylen was utterly unlike anything Kelanie had seen thus far on<br />
  Millimillenary.<br />
  The vertical mouth that divided the triangular head, mounted below<br />
  a pair of large, diagonally-slitted eyes opened briefly, revealing<br />
  rows of long, needle-like teeth.  Suppressing the urge to turn and<br />
  run, Kelanie realised that the Moridani was smiling at her, and that<br />
  the scraping sound was the noise made by the teeth as they slid past<br />
  one another.<br />
  `Pretty nasty, eh?' Tsiry-Feylen said without using a translator.<br />
  Kelanie thought that she recognised the voice.<br />
  `Have we met before?' she enquired politely.  Tsiry-Feylen bared<br />
  her fangs again, bobbed her head.  She replied in a different voice,<br />
  `We're sure that we have...' - she continued in her first voice -<br />
  `dearest.'  Kelanie was certain now.  Marek looked like he was about<br />
  to panic and run, so Kelanie took his arm and murmured reassuringly,<br />
  `It's okay... she's on our side.  Tsiry-Feylen, this is Marek<br />
  Waddell, former owner of Waddell's Emporium of Extremely Fashionable<br />
  Attire and Quite Nice Ice Cream Parlour.'  Tsiry-Feylen splayed her<br />
  front pair of feet slightly, bowing.  `Marek, one of these is-'<br />
  `One of these?  How many are there?'  Tsiry-Feylen settled to the<br />
  floor, folding up neatly like a cat, and replied,<br />
  `Each Moridani has four personalities, each shared with four other<br />
  Moridani... although, as there aren't as many of us as there used to<br />
  be, this practice has declined.  Miss Camden is familiar with our<br />
  &quot;Tsiry&quot; aspect...'  Kelanie smiled.<br />
  `As I was about to say; Marek, I'd like you to meet Robyn Starkey,<br />
  Section Head of the Bureau of Procuration, Syndaine office.  My<br />
  immediate superior.  What I'd like to know is: how do you get away<br />
  with it?'<br />
  `Teleconferencing has been popular for hundreds of years.  Quite a<br />
  few government officials, including humans, hold two, sometimes even<br />
  three positions, under assumed names.  When they have to put in an<br />
  appearance, they do so by video filtered through a cosmetic graphics<br />
  program.  We rarely have time for anything fancy, image-wise, because<br />
  apart from our partisanship, we hold two positions in the Human<br />
  government and one in the NoSan'No'Os Bureaucracy.'  Kelanie looked<br />
  around for something to sit on, saw nothing appropriate, and settled<br />
  for sitting on the floor, cross-legged.  Marek sat next to her.<br />
  Tsiry-Feylen stared at them for a few moments; Kelanie found that she<br />
  had no idea of what Moridani kinesics meant; she would have to rely<br />
  on what she could pick up from Tsiry-Feylen's voice.  `We're afraid<br />
  that we have some bad news for you.  The NoSan'No'Os have completed<br />
  their initial Evaluation of humanity, a study that began almost<br />
  ninety years ago.  Our position in the NoSan'No'Os Bureaucracy has<br />
  allowed us to steal a copy of the preliminary recommendation.'<br />
  `Which is?'<br />
  `In about a month's time, the NoSan'No'Os are going to drop about a<br />
  dozen large asteroids on Earth, followed by another thirty that will<br />
  be dropped into your sun at regular intervals.  This will coincide<br />
  with the arrest and subsequent termination of all free humans<br />
  anywhere in the NoSan'No'Os Dominion.  We must say we're impressed;<br />
  we haven't seen a reaction this extreme since they discovered that<br />
  there were a few of us Moridani still on the loose.' There was a<br />
  moments' silence while they digested this.  Finally, Marek said,<br />
  `Do you expect us to believe that?'  Tsiry-Feylen held out her<br />
  hands and shrugged - a very human gesture.<br />
  `The choice is yours.  You have twenty-seven days.'  Kelanie<br />
  grasped Marek's hand, cleared her throat and said,<br />
  `Do you have any proof?  Something tangible?'  Tsiry-Feylen drew a<br />
  small card made of clouded white plastic, handed it to Kelanie.<br />
  `Nothing that can't be easily faked.  The best way we can think to<br />
  convince you is to show you the activity in your asteroid belt, where<br />
  the Militia are, even as we speak, preparing the projectiles that<br />
  will be - ' Tsiry-Feylen paused, seeing Kelanie and Marek absorbed in<br />
  reading the documentation.  Kelanie had placed the card against her<br />
  notepad's scanner, which read it and translated the NoSan'No'Os<br />
  Tertiary into Anglic.  The message was short:</p>
<p> Office of Risk Evaluation:           Date: 9327685491767632151<br />
  Interdepartmental Action Code: AF1CF3C7F8C65E98A06ED63C87E542C<br />
  Authorisation:  1110011001010001001001001001001001011110101001</p>
<p> NOTE TO ALL DEPARTMENTS</p>
<p> Preliminary evaluation of N-FRF-Knh/K indicates threat<br />
  potential of 97.8 percent.  This is based on evidence of<br />
  innate territorial habits and research into artificial<br />
  intelligence which is currently in progress.  Preliminary<br />
  Recommendation: level six termination, to commence<br />
  immediately, pending availability of resources.  Any further<br />
  enquiries can be directed to the Office of Threat Termination<br />
  on Sthelanar. Work Group: T760   Cost Code : 568384</p>
<p> `You can ignore the last part; the Office of Threat Termination<br />
  report all such enquiries to the Militia as a matter of course.'<br />
  Tsiry-Feylen said.  Marek and Kelanie exchanged glances.<br />
  `You think that Barber-xeno was after us?'  she murmured.<br />
  `It would make sense... round up the strays...' Marek faced the<br />
  Moridani.  `Okay.  If this is all true, then what the hell can we do<br />
  about it?'  Tsiry-Feylen's mouth twitched, exposing a few glittering<br />
  teeth for a moment.<br />
  `You could warn everyone, which would cause panic.  You could do<br />
  nothing, which would mean that your planet would be destroyed with<br />
  most of the inhabitants still on it.  You could try mounting an<br />
  attack on the Bythians in your asteroid belt, which could prove<br />
  difficult given your lack of spacecraft and weapons, and would most<br />
  likely fail, as most attacks on Bythians do.  Or you help with what<br />
  is being done; get as many important people off Earth as possible and<br />
  hide them.'  Kelanie was indignant at this.<br />
  `Important?  Who gets to decide who is important and who isn't?'<br />
  Tsiry-Feylen's head swivelled to face her, eyes narrowed.<br />
  `We do.  We are financing this operation.  We are hiding your<br />
  people in our bases and are assuming the responsibility for making<br />
  sure that they remain hidden.  We are saving any humans who can<br />
  assist us in our war against the NoSan'No'Os.  We do not have the<br />
  resources to hide everyone.  We have been working on this since<br />
  before you were born, Miss Camden; we can only progress when we are<br />
  entirely sure that there is no risk of discovery.'  Kelanie felt a<br />
  numbing chill settle over her as the scope of Tsiry-Feylen's<br />
  revelation sank in.  `We have been hiding from the NoSan'No'Os for<br />
  over seven thousand years; we have never exposed ourselves to the<br />
  possibility of discovery to the degree that we are doing at the<br />
  moment.  The only reason we are doing this: we believe that humanity<br />
  can, one day, help us.  Now, this is what we are going to do next...'</p>
<p> *           *           *           *           *</p>
<p> `The closest a Bythian has ever come to creating a work of<br />
  art or evincing a sense of humour was when the level<br />
  three sub-commander in charge of the assault force on the<br />
  Moridani-held world of Triple-S ordered a bomb-pattern<br />
  that spelled out the words &quot;Up Yours, Ugly&quot; in Moridani<br />
  Phandric.'</p>
<p> - Foley's `Unofficial Documents'</p>
<p> Three large, featureless white-metal shapes made their way down the<br />
  crowded street.  The crowds parted before them, breaking on the<br />
  larger of the three like water on the prow of an icebreaker, flowed<br />
  past the two that followed, the rift quickly healing close behind.<br />
  The first shape was about the size of an elephant; it had four<br />
  strong, stumpy legs at the narrow base of an inverted trapezoid<br />
  shape; two double-jointed mechanical arms were neatly folded at the<br />
  front.  This shape moved deftly, occasionally whirling around to<br />
  check that the other two were following, utilising an involved<br />
  sequence of steps, turning back when it was sure that they were still<br />
  in tow.  They were smaller and obviously of a different species;<br />
  bilaterally symmetrical, two arms and legs.  Where the first shape<br />
  was almost three metres from the ground to the forepeak, the others<br />
  were squat shapes just under two metres tall.  One of them seemed to<br />
  be unsure of the correct method of walking; it stopped with one foot<br />
  in the air every few steps.<br />
  `Crash it, what's wrong with the damn thing NOW?' Kelanie snarled.<br />
  `You're fighting it, Kelanie; try dropping force-feedback a few<br />
  notches-'<br />
  `Or turn it off altogether.  You may get tired, but it won't matter<br />
  in the short term.'  Kelanie sighed, hunted for the force-feedback<br />
  control mounted somewhere on the inner face of her land-mate battle<br />
  suit and replied,<br />
  `I can understand why you need a suit like this, Tsiry-Feylen; but<br />
  why the hell do we-'<br />
  `The Bythians are probably looking for you by now.  We stand a<br />
  better chance of getting away with this if they think we are someone<br />
  else.'<br />
  `You don't mean that we will have to wear these suits until we get<br />
  back to Earth?' Kelanie wailed.  She had only just become used to the<br />
  new-vinyl smell of the inside of the land-mate; the spread of the<br />
  leg-spaces was rubbing painfully on the insides of her thighs, and<br />
  she half-expected to be bow-legged when she finally divested herself<br />
  of the thing.<br />
  `Once inside the ship and safely away, you can take them off.  We,<br />
  however, that is, we-myself, won't risk exposure until we have safely<br />
  reached the Moridani base in the asteroids... assuming that the<br />
  Threat Termination team haven't lobbed it into the sun... anyway, we<br />
  are quite comfortable in this suit.  We-myself have spent weeks at a<br />
  stretch in it.'<br />
  `We-yourself are probably a couple of cans short of a six-pack.'<br />
  Kelanie muttered.  Tsiry-Feylen laughed.<br />
  `By your standards, we probably are.  Uh-oh - quiet, children...'<br />
  They were passing four Bythians who were checking ID bracelets.<br />
  Tsiry-Feylen had been able to remove Kelanie's bracelet, providing a<br />
  similar one which now hung on the outside of Kelanie's suit.  The<br />
  Bythians grabbed one arm of Tsiry-Feylen's armour carelessly,<br />
  dragging it closer to read the pattern of dots on the tag that hung<br />
  on the leading edge of her suit.  They assumed a marginally more<br />
  respectful attitude after they had read it; Tsiry-Feylen was posing<br />
  as an important government official.  She snatched her arm from the<br />
  Bythian's grasp, made an involved gesture with it, and the four<br />
  Militia stepped aside.  They proceeded; Kelanie angled one of her<br />
  shoulder-boom-mounted cameras backwards and watched them.  The<br />
  Bythians were ignoring them.<br />
  `Will these disguises get us past the ExPort authority?' She asked.<br />
  `We were hoping that you wouldn't ask that.' Tsiry-Feylen sighed.<br />
  `We think so.  We have used this disguise before, and have never<br />
  encountered any problems.  Mind you, we didn't have two pesky humans<br />
  in tow then.  We are prepared to fight if necessary, although small-<br />
  arms combat with Bythians is something we'd rather watch on video<br />
  than participate in.'  Kelanie's suit paused, one foot in the air,<br />
  lagging behind Marek and Tsiry-Feylen for a moment, then catching up<br />
  again.<br />
  `(Damn it!) Do you think we'll be in a shoot-out?  I feel like a<br />
  sitting duck in this thing!  Does it have any weapons?'  Tsiry made a<br />
  reproaching tsk-tsk sound.<br />
  `You're supposed to be a Bureau of Procuration operative, not some<br />
  gun-nut weapons system expert!  Your suit doesn't have any energy-<br />
  weapons, but if you turned the force-feedback up all the way, you<br />
  could easily put your fist through the side of a NoSan'No'Os<br />
  transport.  That also applies to the leg-movements; with the force-<br />
  feedback on full, you could leap up to a third-storey balcony, or<br />
  jump off the roof and land safely.  So be careful.'  The thought of<br />
  being that strong appealed to Kelanie; when they stopped at an<br />
  intersection to let a line of what appeared to be Parkry children<br />
  pass by, she started experimenting with the controls.<br />
  First, she played with the response-time fine-tuning, and found<br />
  that this was the cause of her suit's lagging behind on some steps<br />
  and anticipating others.  When it was tuned properly, she could<br />
  almost feel it slip into place.  She flexed the fingers in front of<br />
  the shoulder-boom-mounted cameras, bent the knees.  It suddenly felt<br />
  like a second skin; a feeling of energetic euphoria that she'd only<br />
  experienced previously when absorbed in a complex gymnastic routine.<br />
  Inside the suit, she grinned, turned the force-feedback control to<br />
  the `x4' position and tapped her toes.  The suit responded, jumping<br />
  three feet off the ground, landing on the flat, splay-toed feet, the<br />
  knees bending automatically to absorb the shock.<br />
  `Yahooo!' she shouted, turning the control to the `x8' position and<br />
  leaping eight metres into the air, performing a somersault and<br />
  landing on the other side of the street in a gap barely big enough to<br />
  accommodate the suit.<br />
  `Kelanie!' Tsiry-Feylen froze her suit by remote control.  `If you<br />
  want to draw attention to yourself, you can take all your clothes off<br />
  and run down the street.  Try to keep our situation in mind, please.'</p>
<p> *           *           *           *           *</p>
<p> Tsiry-Feylen poked a camera-boom around the corner, scanned the<br />
  broad courtyard outside the ExPort.  Two more booms, mounted on<br />
  Kelanie's and Marek's suits respectively, appeared just underneath<br />
  Tsiry-Feylen's.  There were at least thirty Bythians arranged around<br />
  the courtyard, and even to Kelanie's untrained perception, they<br />
  weren't merely on guard.  Someone had anticipated them.<br />
  `Wait here, children... We've arranged a reception for our fascist<br />
  friends - some Pthalklin Ervae - when we give the signal, we want you<br />
  to run straight into the ship.'  Even as Tsiry-Feylen spoke, Kelanie<br />
  saw a movement in the decorative shrubbery arranged around the<br />
  triangular doorways of the geodesic dome... then she realised that<br />
  the movement wasn't caused by someone hiding in the bushes; the<br />
  movement _was_ the bushes.  Six plants, shaped like large agapanths,<br />
  a central shaft topped by what appeared to be a large red pineapple,<br />
  moving on round platforms that hovered a few centimetres off the<br />
  ground, emerged from the less ambulatory shrubs.  Sharp, compressed-<br />
  air sounds came from within their broadly-spread leaves; half the<br />
  Bythians fell to the ground with large holes blown through them.<br />
  Thin yellow blood sprayed about.  The remaining Bythians immediately<br />
  returned the fire, microwave weapons causing three of the plants to<br />
  burst into flame.  There was a massive explosion in the corner<br />
  nearest the Moridani and the humans; flat pieces of concrete chipped<br />
  off the courtyard corner wall clattered off their armour.  When<br />
  Tsiry-Feylen dared to put a boom-camera around the corner again, she<br />
  saw two of the plants nudging the bodies of the Bythians into a heap.<br />
  She gestured to Kelanie and Marek and dodged nimbly around the<br />
  corner.  They ran after her, pausing only briefly when she stopped to<br />
  confer with the two surviving Pthalklin Ervae.<br />
  Inside the ExPort building, everything had stopped at the sound of<br />
  the explosion.  Parkry seated next to their dataposts regarded them<br />
  blankly.  Kelanie went to leap over the short barrier that laterally<br />
  divided the room in two; she seemed to strike an invisible, flexible<br />
  barrier and fell on her behind with a crash.<br />
  `What the line-noise was THAT?'  Marek stumped over to help her up,<br />
  reached out and twanged a set of invisible wires strung over the<br />
  barrier.<br />
  `Monofilament.  Lucky we're wearing these suits, or we'd be on the<br />
  other side - in thin slices.'  He walked over to the gap in the<br />
  barrier, and kicked out the door.  It flew across the room and<br />
  embedded itself in the far wall, end first, with a short metallic<br />
  screech.  The Parkry hopped back nervously as the two passed through<br />
  the gap and ran up the ramp into the ship.<br />
  They turned left at the first corridor inside the ship, and found<br />
  themselves face-to-face with a Bythian, who was raising his weapon.<br />
  Without thinking, Kelanie lashed out with one of the suit's arms,<br />
  back-handing the Bythian flat against the wall with terrible force,<br />
  killing it instantly.  She crouched to pick up the plastic gun,<br />
  examined it.  It looked something like an automatic rifle, with a<br />
  long rectangular magazine jammed in the base; there was nothing that<br />
  obviously resembled a trigger.  She shrugged within the suit and<br />
  bashed the gun against the starship wall, snapping the barrel.  She<br />
  angled the two shoulder-mounted booms forward, extended them to their<br />
  full reach of two metres and tip-toed up the corridor, peeking up the<br />
  side corridors as they progressed.  As they approached the end of the<br />
  corridor, they heard the hum of a Bythian microwave weapon, coming<br />
  from the right-hand branch of the intersection.  Immediately<br />
  afterwards, a grey shape flew through the air, past them and down the<br />
  left-hand branch of the intersection.  A large white shape ran after<br />
  the grey shape; they barely had time to recognise Tsiry-Feylen in her<br />
  battle-suit.  They ran to the intersection, and saw Tsiry-Feylen<br />
  holding a Bythian by its legs, batting its head against the wall with<br />
  measured ferocity.  When the Bythian came apart, she dropped the<br />
  pieces she was holding, stamped on the head with both of the<br />
  battle-suit's front legs, abruptly span through one hundred and<br />
  eighty degrees and punched out a wall panel with both hands.  She<br />
  reached in, extracted the dented panel and tossed it over their<br />
  heads.  Kelanie heard a soft squelching sound, and turned a boom-<br />
  mounted camera back to see a Bythian, crushed against the further end<br />
  of the corridor behind the wall panel.  While Tsiry-Feylen was<br />
  working on the machinery behind the panel, tearing cables out and<br />
  poking fingers into control-spaces, another Bythian appeared down the<br />
  corridor, at the ship's hatch.  It levelled its weapon at something<br />
  outside; that something slashed at the Bythian's neck, severing the<br />
  axe-shaped head and knocking its weapon aside.  One of the Pthalklin<br />
  Ervae hovered up the ramp and through the hatch.  The entire ship<br />
  shuddered, rocked; the suits' internal gyros keeping balance.<br />
  Tsiry-Feylen darted between them, off down another corridor.  They<br />
  ran after her.</p>
<p> The ship had lifted with its hatches still open; the air thinned,<br />
  vanishing completely when they had reached low orbit, except for the<br />
  room in which they had secured the Pthalklin Ervae.  Tsiry- Feylen<br />
  had been rushing from one end of the ship to the other, checking the<br />
  most likely hiding places.<br />
  `If there are any more Bythians, they should be dead by now. The<br />
  ship had landed only four hours ago, so there shouldn't have been<br />
  anyone else on board.  When we've reached our allocated departure<br />
  point, we-myself will have finished searching the entire ship; we can<br />
  close the hatches and refill the ship's air supply from the stores.'<br />
  Kelanie's suit gestured to Marek.<br />
  `Come on, I want to see Millimillenary from space!'  they stamped<br />
  off down the half-lit corridor while Tsiry-Feylen stalked through the<br />
  ship, kicking service-hatches open, thrusting her camera-booms<br />
  rapidly in and out of the circular doors of the berths, finding<br />
  nothing.  There were no more Bythians on board.</p>
<p> Kelanie and Marek were leaning out of a hatch in the underside of<br />
  the ship, into open space.  Below them, the golden surface of<br />
  Millimillenary was spread out, the faint grey gridwork of the city<br />
  visible even from this altitude.  Their suit radios beeped, and<br />
  Tsiry-Feylen said,<br />
  `Heads up, children, we're about to close the hatches.'  They<br />
  pulled back into the corridor as the black-glass hatchway rippled<br />
  into existence.  Almost immediately, their suits lost some of the<br />
  stiffness that came with vacuum.  They made their way back to what<br />
  Tsiry-Feylen thought was the pilot's ward-room, and when the air<br />
  pressure was adequate, they gratefully divested themselves of the<br />
  battle-suits.<br />
  `Ohhh... praise &quot;Bob&quot;, that's a relief.'  said Marek, stretching.<br />
  Tsiry-Feylen made no move to take off her suit.  Kelanie reached for<br />
  her toes, straightened, arched her back and wondered how Tsiry-Feylen<br />
  could stand to be confined in her suit for such long periods.  The<br />
  Moridani spoke through an audio port mounted on the side of her suit:<br />
  `We're half-way home, children,  although you should both know that<br />
  the most dangerous part is still ahead of us.  We'd like you to set<br />
  up a recorder on the ship's communications column to monitor the<br />
  trade channels.  Then go and make sure the Pthalklin Ervae is safe.<br />
  We've prepared a brief knowledge-base for you, describing most of the<br />
  dangerous features of this ship; familiarise yourselves with it.'<br />
  She handed them a white plastic card.  `Meanwhile, we are going to<br />
  spy on the enemy.'</p>
<p> Kelanie and Marek sat cross-legged on top of a shipping container<br />
  in the cargo bay, where the Pthalklin Ervae (whose name, apparently,<br />
  was `Kayren-Kayley') had broken open about a dozen plastic bags<br />
  filled with soil, and was spreading it evenly across the floor.<br />
  On closer examination, the Ervae was not really an intelligent<br />
  plant, but rather a living hive, host to thousands of tiny insects<br />
  acting in communion with the plant, communicating via chemical tags.<br />
  Individually, the insects were very simple; each acted out complex,<br />
  genetically-programmed motions, forming the basis of an intricate<br />
  object-oriented intelligence program.  Conversations - conducted<br />
  between Kelanie's notepad and the plant's spectrographic interpreter-<br />
  were hampered by the plant's slow reaction-times.<br />
  `No, I don't see it as a handicap,' Marek said, `But if your<br />
  species has such slow reflexes, then how can you effectively support<br />
  yourselves as mercenaries?'  Kelanie's notepad converted his words<br />
  into NoSan'No'Os Tertiary and transmitted them to the Pthalklin<br />
  Ervae's interpreter, which rendered them as a pattern of pheromones,<br />
  spraying at the insects that teemed in the diagonal interstices of<br />
  the pineapple-shaped top.  An airborne caste of the insects replied,<br />
  dancing and spreading pheromones against the interpreter's reading<br />
  plate, which then spoke to Kelanie's notepad, in Tertiary.<br />
  `The next-to-smallest components of us are the equivalent of your<br />
  computers.' it said.  `Once instructed, they can operate with great<br />
  speed.  We have several sets of components that know how to react to<br />
  situations, and we cycle through these sets, modifying them as<br />
  necessary.  The largest delays occur when we have to communicate with<br />
  animals who don't have the requisite sense-organs to read our<br />
  chemical expressions directly.'  Kelanie sighed.<br />
  `Typical.'  Kayren-Kayley slowly crawled off her platform,<br />
  wriggling her knobbed roots into the soil.</p>

<p>&lt;661528&gt; oh dear, its 997193</p>
<p>&lt;200211&gt; (bums) to the wall!</p>
<p>&lt;997193&gt; oh shut up, you two.</p>
<p>&lt;000077&gt; How goes it on the Dominion's latest trouble spot, 997193?</p>
<p>&lt;200211&gt; (snicker)</p>
<p>&lt;997193&gt; we are pulling the plug, didn't you hear? level six<br />

<p>&lt;661528&gt; What?  Those Poor Little N-FRF-Knh/K?  Level SIX?</p>
<p>&lt;997193&gt; you have obviously never worked with them, 661528.  swine<br />
  &lt;997193&gt; of the first order.  i'll be glad when they are all wiped<br />
  &lt;997193&gt; out.  you just can't rely on them to behave predictably<br />
  &lt;997193&gt; from one season to the next.</p>
<p>&lt;661528&gt; Never Trust Anything With Less Than Six Legs.</p>
<p>&lt;200211&gt; and how many legs do *_you_* have, 661528?  o=o</p>
<p>&lt;000077&gt; Wasn't that operation supposed to be taking place in about<br />
  &lt;000077&gt; six month's time, 997193?</p>
<p>&lt;997193&gt; it was.  there has been so much bother with the second and<br />
  &lt;997193&gt; third threat evaluation that Up-On-High ordered us to cut<br />
  &lt;997193&gt; our losses and trash the whole species.  as soon as.</p>
<p>&lt;200211&gt; (gulp) crikey!</p>
<p>&lt;000077&gt; If Up-On-High has taken an interest in it, then it's all<br />
  &lt;000077&gt; for the best... as long as the Circle remains unbroken...<br />
  &lt;000077&gt; so, now that you *_officially_* have no subject planet,<br />
  &lt;000077&gt; where next, 997193?</p>
<p>&lt;997193&gt; oh, I'd like to be assigned to the Moridani sweep<br />
  &lt;997193&gt; operation.</p>
<p>&lt;661528&gt; Seriously?  You Think There Are Still Moridani About?</p>
<p>&lt;000077&gt; We KNOW that they are still about, 661528.  Didn't you<br />

<p> `Gulp.  Crikey.' muttered Tsiry-Feylen.</p>
<p> After the ships' first shift from physical-space to probable-space<br />
  and back, Kelanie and Marek had found some thick padded mats in a<br />
  hold of the ship and were lying on them, in the ward-room, after an<br />
  unsuccessful attempt at making love on the curved floor of the<br />
  berths.<br />
  `If we're going to put together a bed, it might as well be in the<br />
  ward-room,' Kelanie said.  Marek hesitated; (despite being brought up<br />
  on Millimillenary, he was not comfortable with the idea of appearing<br />
  naked before xenoforms, even Tsiry-Feylen); but only for a moment.<br />
  The ship's communication channels hissed faintly, the sound broken<br />
  by the occasional beep to indicate that the ship had passed out of<br />
  the effective range of one gravitic beacon and into another.  Twice,<br />
  a voice on the channels had spoken, in NoSan'No'Os Tertiary; Marek<br />
  translated.<br />
  `They're asking us if we need assistance.  They've assumed that the<br />
  Bythians killed us.'<br />
  `Meaning that they can't accept the possibility that we killed the<br />
  Bythians?'  Marek nodded.  `They're more hide-bound than I thought.<br />
  How they've kept hold of control for this long is a mystery to me.'<br />
  Tsiry-Feylen entered, still wearing her battle suit, docilely<br />
  followed by Kayren.  She replied to Kelanie's musings:<br />
  `It's because the situation is being handled locally, so far.  As<br />
  soon as it is referred up to a Parkry that doesn't mind admitting<br />
  that it has no idea of what to do next, then it will become a matter<br />
  for the Millimillenarian NapaiSUB and the Bythians.  That's when we<br />
  may be in trouble.'  Tsiry-Feylen stalked over to the control board,<br />
  poked fingers into a group of control-spaces, deactivating video<br />
  screens, muting the hissing of the communication channels.  She<br />
  continued;  `We have to announce a slight change of plans, children.'<br />
  Kelanie retorted,<br />
  `Would you _please_ stop calling us that?'  Still working at the<br />
  ranked banks of control columns, Tsiry-Feylen waved the camera-booms<br />
  of her suit in a manner reminiscent of the pattern used, by the<br />
  insectoid Kaelen, to indicate amusement.<br />
  `If you wish.  As we were saying: we will stop over at the asteroid<br />
  base to visit my sister before we make for Earth.  The situation has<br />
  changed slightly.'  Marek left off kissing Kelanie's neck to ask,<br />
  `When will you tell us exactly what's going on?  What we will do<br />
  when we reach Earth?'  Tsiry-Feylen sat her suit down, the legs<br />
  folding up underneath like a cat's.<br />
  `If we told you everything, if we gave you the statistics that<br />
  govern our movements against the NoSan'No'Os, you would both probably<br />
  walk out of the airlock without your suits.  Be content with knowing<br />
  that you will both, most likely, be able to live out your allotted<br />
  lifetimes.  Which is more than can be said for the rest of humanity.'<br />
  Kelanie lay back on the pile of matting, staring at the ceiling of<br />
  the ward-room, and said,<br />
  `I've been meaning to ask you about that, Robyn.'  In her suit,<br />
  Tsiry-Feylen smiled, baring her needle teeth.  `If we are stopping<br />
  over on Earth, how much of a risk would it be to let a few of our<br />
  most trusted friends know what's going to happen, and invite them<br />
  onboard?  There's room on this ship for at least a hundred people.'<br />
  Abruptly, Tsiry-Feylen's suit cracked down the middle and opened like<br />
  the two halves of a hotdog bun.  She stepped out, blinking in the<br />
  watery yellow sodium light, and shook her legs in pairs.<br />
  `We have no objection to that... if you would like to prepare some<br />
  text mail messages - we can't risk video, because even humans can tap<br />
  into that - we will send them through a secure channel, after making<br />
  sure that the NoSan'No'Os monitors in the mail network can't pick up<br />
  on what we are doing by reading them.'  Kelanie was surprised.<br />
  `Do you mean to say that the NoSan'No'Os manage to read ALL the<br />
  mail?' Tsiry-Feylen grinned, exposing a frightening array of dental<br />
  work.<br />
  `That's why they have a machine monitoring it.  If it wasn't for<br />
  the organisational skills of the NoSan'No'Os Artificial intelligence<br />
  and the diligence of its sub-units, the Dominion would have collapsed<br />
  long ago.'<br />
  `How many people can we rescue?'  Tsiry-Feylen spread her six-<br />
  fingered hands in a gesture of apology.<br />
  `Limit it to six or less.  We have already allocated the rest of<br />
  the space for cargo; there is a lot of equipment that we have to get<br />
  off Earth before Threat Termination blow it.'  Marek glanced at<br />
  Kelanie, and then said slowly,<br />
  `That isn't going to happen for six months, though, isn't it?'<br />
  Tsiry-Feylen spun about nimbly on her six legs, gestured to the<br />
  Pthalklin Ervae and left without answering, followed by Kayren.<br />
  Marek and Kelanie glanced worriedly at each other.</p>
<p> Some twenty hours later, when Kelanie and Marek had decided to give<br />
  the spherical sleeping-berths a second chance, Tsiry-Feylen raced<br />
  past in her battle-armour, shouting to them;<br />
  `Suit up.  We have company.'  They disentangled themselves and<br />
  scrambled for the suits that were kneeling, opened like clam- shells,<br />
  in a corner of the ward-room.  Over the suit radios, Tsiry-Feylen<br />
  brought them up to date.<br />
  `The ship reentered physical-space just inside the asteroid belt as<br />
  expected; what we didn't count on was the entire belt being thick<br />
  with Bythian scouts.  We understand that they are still preparing the<br />
  assault on Earth.  There's a scout approaching, crew of four,<br />
  informing us that it is about to dock.  We haven't responded yet.<br />
  Come down to the lower fore airlock.'<br />
  When they got there, Tsiry-Feylen was replacing a panel on the side<br />
  of the hatch, hammering the lock-bolts home with her flattened palm.<br />
  `We're going to have to lure them out and then blow the hatch; we<br />
  hope the decompression will kill them all.  We want you both to back<br />
  up this corridor, just there, around that corner; if one of them gets<br />
  past, kick the stuffing out of it.'  Tsiry-Feylen's suit crouched<br />
  down directly in front of the hatch, clutching a handful of sharp<br />
  metal fragments.  There was a minute's silence, and then the plastic<br />
  of the hatchway creaked under an unfamiliar stress.  Kelanie, braced<br />
  against a data column in the passageway, poked the tip of a<br />
  boom-mounted camera around the corner, patching the image through to<br />
  Marek's suit.  The black glass door of the hatch rippled away, and<br />
  two Bythians leapt through, weapons drawn.  They didn't recognise<br />
  Tsiry-Feylen's crouching tank-shape for a moment; a third Bythian had<br />
  stepped through the hatch when the first two whipped up their guns.<br />
  Too late; Tsiry-Feylen flicked the fragments at them with as much<br />
  strength as her suit could impart; they punched through the Bythian's<br />
  heads and necks, embedding themselves in the wall behind them.  As<br />
  the bodies collapsed, she set off the explosives that she'd packed<br />
  into the hatchway; there was a sharp crack, and a shock-wave pushed<br />
  Tsiry-Feylen's suit back against the wall, where she grabbed hold of<br />
  a stanchion.  The shock-wave suddenly reversed as air rushed out, the<br />
  hatch crackling and buzzing as it tried to cover over the enlarged<br />
  hole.  The scream of escaping air quickly diminished to a hiss, and<br />
  then stopped as the hatch-field closed.  Tsiry-Feylen was checking an<br />
  external camera on her suit monitors; she relayed the images to<br />
  Kelanie and Marek, who watched as the torn globe of the Bythian scout<br />
  ship spun off into the distance; the tiny figure of the fourth<br />
  Bythian wriggling in open vacuum, gradually becoming still.</p>
<p> Among the debris that drifted around in the trailing LaGrange point<br />
  of Mars was a rock, about two metres along its longest axis.<br />
  Indistinguishable from the other orbital rubbish, it hung there,<br />
  apparently inert, until it decided to distinguish itself from its<br />
  more sedentary companions by suddenly rotating forty degrees, aiming<br />
  itself at a spot somewhere in the outer fringe of the solar system.<br />
  Another rock, in the leading LaGrange point, did the same.  They were<br />
  now both pointing to a spot about twelve million miles above the<br />
  plane of the ecliptic; inside each rock, mass-sensors triangulated,<br />
  fixing the position of one of the NoSan'No'Os projectiles.  Satisfied<br />
  that the asteroid was where it was supposed to be (although not where<br />
  they would prefer it), the small but capable artificial intelligences<br />
  in the spy-satellites oriented on another asteroid, and another.<br />
  When they were satisfied that they had correctly placed all the known<br />
  threats, they did a general half-hearted scan for any other sizable<br />
  objects that weren't where they should be.  Surprisingly, they found<br />
  one, an asteroid of some two thousand and seventy tonnes that,<br />
  according to their very accurate and up-to-date database, should be<br />
  at least two million miles further out.  Then they spotted another.<br />
  Then four more.  Approaching a state that could best be described as<br />
  `alarm', the two spy-satellites sent a coded signal on the gravitic<br />
  channel that was, until recently, used by the NoSan'No'Os as the main<br />
  data link for Earth-bound communications.  Use of this frequency<br />
  would arouse the least amount of suspicion if the Bythians were<br />
  listening in.  The spy-satellites knew that the intended recipient of<br />
  the message would always be listening.<br />
  Suddenly, faster than even electronic reflexes could allow for, the<br />
  spherical shape of a Bythian scout shot past, loosing a stream of<br />
  stone chips at high velocity, battering the spy-satellite into<br />
  inactivity.</p>
<p> `How many asteroids are there in the asteroid belt?' Marek asked.<br />
  `...don't know,' Kelanie replied absently, scanning the starfield.<br />
  `hundreds of thousands, I suppose... what I'd like to know is, where<br />
  are they all?'<br />
  `We've seen your illustrations of the asteroid belt,' Tsiry-Feylen<br />
  commented, `and we can assure you that the ratio of rocks to empty<br />
  space is several magnitudes smaller than they would have us believe.<br />
  Like physical reality... it's mostly vacuum.'  She stood at the<br />
  control column, twitching fingers thrust into the control-spaces,<br />
  slowly rotating the ship, looking for a particular pattern of stars.<br />
  She aligned a single glittering spot on the screen in front of her,<br />
  rotated the ship on its forward axis and drove it forward.  While one<br />
  hand monitored the ship's velocity, the other activated the<br />
  communications system embedded inside the front of her battle suit,<br />
  which was propped open next to the control column.  Two of her voices<br />
  chattered rapidly, and were answered by two others from the comms<br />
  system.  Kelanie's notepad could make nothing of it; the exchanges<br />
  were too rapid, switching back and forth with inhuman speed.<br />
  The spot on the screen that represented their destination hadn't<br />
  changed size appreciably; Tsiry-Feylen left off chattering for a<br />
  moment, stuck all her fingers into a bank of control-spaces and said,<br />
  `Hang on, children.'  Marek grabbed Kelanie, who, having nothing<br />
  better to do, wrapped her arms around him.  The ship lurched forward,<br />
  spilling them backwards, over the pile of mats.  They had enough time<br />
  to struggle to their knees when the ship moved in a different<br />
  direction, shifting from underneath them.  Kayren, mounted in a<br />
  corner as unobtrusively as an office pot-plant, merely swayed<br />
  slightly.  Tsiry-Feylen, who had remained upright through all this,<br />
  gestured towards the screen.<br />
  `Here we are.'  The screen was filled with rock-textured grey,<br />
  sharp black highlights slowly shifting as the asteroid rotated.<br />
  Tsiry-Feylen made a few delicate adjustments to the ship's attitude,<br />
  matching spin, and then nudged it forward.  Suddenly, off to the<br />
  left, the featureless asteroid face split open along seven radial<br />
  lines, the triangular segments folding back like flower petals.  The<br />
  now-familiar white shape of a Moridani battle-suit emerged, legs<br />
  kicking, holding a struggling something in its arms.  The Moridani<br />
  kicked the shape - a Bythian in a torn pressure suit - away, the<br />
  reaction of which pushed the battle-suit back towards the hatch.  The<br />
  arms extended as far as possible, scrabbling against the hatchway<br />
  petals.  The chattering sound came from Tsiry-Feylen's suit resumed<br />
  briefly.  Tsiry-Feylen sighed, and said,<br />
  `It seems that Threat Termination have decided to use this asteroid<br />
  after all.  Kendr-Saranaxio-Parndta-Athanasius - our dear sister -<br />
  has dealt with the scouts... but Threat Termination will soon wonder<br />
  why this asteroid isn't moving.  We're going to try and bluff them.'</p>

<p> `That's slack.  For Bythians, that is slack.'  Kendr-Saranaxio was<br />
  a slightly smaller version of her sister, moving with sharp,<br />
  efficient grace.  She shut down the video-simulator, which she had<br />
  played like a puppet-master, transmitting a convincing portrayal of a<br />
  Bythian scout, mimicking its phrases.  `We don't think that they<br />
  believe us.'  Tsiry-Feylen spoke to her in rapid-fire bursts of<br />
  Moridani; Kendr-Saranaxio replied with a single word, which sounded<br />
  something like `fs'yen'.  Both Moridani bared their teeth in what<br />
  Kelanie assumed were smiles.  Kendr-Saranaxio summoned her<br />
  battle-suit, which walked into the docking bay of its own accord,<br />
  opening as it entered.<br />
  `Stay here, children.  We are going to set off some fireworks.'</p>

  power is somehow stored in a sort of semi-stable carbon<br />
  lattice... yes, that *_is_* rather vague; this is because<br />
  CCI - a monopoly on efficient power-conversion technology-<br />
  is one of the three things that keep the NoSan'No'Os in<br />
  control.  There's no percentage in giving that sort of<br />
  information away.</p>
<p> Aln Riker, from `Riker's Defense', NoSaNoOs<br />
  Interdiction Trial Records</p>
<p> Kelanie, Marek and Kayren were huddled together in a corner of a<br />
  room adjacent to the docking bay of the Moridani base.  The humans<br />
  were in their suits again; they were all listening to Kendr-<br />
  Saranaxio counting down to the detonation of the Bythian scout's CCI<br />
  charges that had been set three kilometres from the asteroid.  Marek<br />
  and Kelanie were discussing the ease with which they had overcome the<br />
  Bythians so far.<br />
  `I once saw a nine-hour epic video that relates to this,' Kelanie<br />
  said.  `It was about a world that was so inhospitable that the<br />
  inhabitants became natural warriors... they spread throughout the<br />
  galaxy, but once they'd conquered everyone in sight, they<br />
  deteriorated, because they lacked real opposition.'   Marek agreed.<br />
  `The Bythians on Millimillenary were a pretty soft bunch.  You'd<br />
  hear reports of how a team of six Bythians had taken on an entire<br />
  planet of dissidents and wiped them out completely; yet, there were<br />
  always messages on SubVerSiveNet about how Bythians kept blowing<br />
  their feet off, because they didn't know how to operate their weapons<br />
  properly.'  A soft pinging tone indicated that Kayren had something<br />
  to say.  They waited politely for the translation:<br />
  `The Bythian reputation is well-founded; during the Second<br />
  Expansion, they were ferocious, efficient and almost without regard<br />
  for their safety.  It was a common technique for a Bythian to steer a<br />
  scout-ship, loaded with CCI charges, into the middle of a group of<br />
  enemy shuttles and set off the charges.  We partly attribute their<br />
  decline to a lack of suitable opposition and partly to their maturity<br />
  as a species.  When they were created - and this was told to me by a<br />
  Bythian just before I killed it - they felt that they had no racial<br />
  identity, and thus had less to live for.'  Kelanie asked,<br />
  `Just how powerful are these CCI charge things?'  Tsiry-Feylen said<br />
  over the radio:<br />
  `Brace yourselves, children; you're about to find out.'  There were<br />
  three distant thumping sounds; echoes of the shock waves, transmitted<br />
  through the thin layer of gases that were a result of the detonation<br />
  of the CCI charges.  There was a pause, during which Marek said,<br />
  `Well, that wasn't so-'  and then the entire base shifted as if God<br />
  had kicked it.   There was a crash as some unsecured containers fell<br />
  over; the entire base creaked as if it were being twisted.  Kelanie<br />
  felt a ghostly acceleration inside; the base was under power, moving.<br />
  She unclamped her suit from Marek's, stood up and tried to open the<br />
  door to the docking bay.  It was locked.  She raised a boom-mounted<br />
  camera to the small, round window mounted in the centre of the door,<br />
  peered through.  She could see a corner of the open gate through<br />
  which Tsiry-Feylen had steered the NoSan'No'Os ship, part of a<br />
  star-field that was rolling in a dizzying fashion.  Tsiry-Feylen<br />
  spoke:<br />
  `Okay, children, we're on our way.  We will be in Earth orbit<br />
  within forty hours, unless we get stopped for exceeding the speed<br />
  limit.  Kelanie, could you meet us in the garage, please?'  A map of<br />
  the Moridani base appeared on Kelanie's heads-up display, with a blue<br />
  arrow marking the location of the garage.</p>
<p> `We have been giving some thought as to your future as a partisan.'<br />
  Tsiry-Feylen and Kendr-Saranaxio were sitting on rugs woven with<br />
  intricate patterns in shades of grey, legs folded underneath.<br />
  Kelanie was sitting inside the opened shell of her battle-armour,<br />
  eyes closed.<br />
  `I still don't believe any of this.  I suppose that it's a failing<br />
  of mine... I just can't encompass the idea of genocide.  Human<br />
  genocide, in particular.'  Tsiry-Feylen sent some text to Kelanie's<br />
  heads-up display; she grabbed the eye-piece, read it; replies to her<br />
  mail-messages, from her friends.</p>
<p> ==========================================================<br />
  kel, we'll try and be there - everything has gone crazy in<br />
  the past week,  the NoSan'No'Os have withdrawn completely,<br />
  the  news services  have  been canceled,  there isn't any<br />
  fast transport available  -  we'll be hitching a ride with<br />
  Baralascopae,   remember him?   the ultralight enthusiast.<br />
  if we can find him.  there are  all kinds  of  wild rumors<br />
  flying  around,  like  the  machine-virus  one;  the  most<br />
  persistent  is the one about a giant asteroid that's about<br />
  to hit the earth; we can't check this out, because all the<br />
  satellite  observatories are owned by the NoSan'No'Os.  or<br />
  were.  what's  going  on?  fondly  (but  nervously all the<br />
  same), :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::gaeren, gen and mileva<br />
  ==========================================================</p>
<p> Kelanie closed her eyes again.  Kendr-Saranaxio said,<br />
  `There are two ways you can take this.  You can sit back and let it<br />
  happen, pretend that there's nothing you can do about it - ' Kelanie<br />
  snorted cynically.  `... or you can fight back.'<br />
  `Is that going to save anyone?'<br />
  `It's too late for that.  We have seen this happen to six other<br />
  civilisations... each time, we managed to save some of them, only to<br />
  watch them submit to apathy.  We had hoped that humanity would be<br />
  different.'  Kelanie sat up in her battle-suit.<br />
  `I don't think you understand - I'm not a warrior; I don't know<br />
  anything about weapons - I'm a prostitute!  You,' pointing at<br />
  Tsiry-Feylen, `pretending to be Robyn, you assigned me to<br />
  Millimillenary - why me?  Why not a weapons specialist, why not<br />
  someone who could do a better job of attacking the NoSan'No'Os?'<br />
  `Human weapons specialists no longer exist.  The NoSan'No'Os<br />
  proscribed human weapons research.  In our limited capability with<br />
  the Bureau of Procuration, we checked everyone that we could for the<br />
  qualities that we need.  You came out on top.'  Kelanie sneered,<br />
  falling back into the suit.<br />
  `Oh, I'm sure that the ability to deliver a good blow-job is<br />
  essential to partisanship.'  Tsiry-Feylen bared her teeth.<br />
  `The qualities we are looking for include adaptability, quick<br />
  reflexes and a willingness to believe that the impossible can, at<br />
  least, be attempted.'  She got up, padded over to the side of<br />
  Kelanie's suit.  `We once found a human weapon specialist... he was<br />
  one of the first people to travel off-world when the NoSan'No'Os<br />
  arrived.  He had definite ideas about what could be done and what<br />
  couldn't, and he had no inclination to change those ideas or broaden<br />
  his horizons.'<br />
  `What happened to him?'<br />
  `He joined a group of Pthalklin Ervae on Copperla, and a Bythian<br />
  killed him.  The point is, while he knew a great deal about military<br />
  matters, his knowledge got in the way - he couldn't conceive of<br />
  battles fought with asteroids, for example, and he refused to even<br />
  consider the one thing that the NoSan'No'Os fear above all.'  Kelanie<br />
  opened her eyes.<br />
  `Which is?'  Tsiry-Feylen held up the video-eyepiece which had been<br />
  connected to Kelanie's notepad.  `Biological augmentation.<br />
  Man-machine interfaces.  Do you recall the first thing that the<br />
  NoSan'No'Os did when they arrived?'<br />
  `After taking over and disassembling our nuclear capability, they<br />
  laid down guidelines for acceptable research, warning us that if we<br />
  stepped outside those guidelines, they would be reinforced with a<br />
  show of military strength.'<br />
  `And at the top of the list of prohibited technology?'<br />
  `Artificial intelligence.  Genetic engineering.  Virtual reality.<br />
  Biological modification.'<br />
  `- and the NoSan'No'Os believe that humans, even unmodified, are<br />
  such a threat that you have to be wiped out completely.  Can you see<br />
  that they fear you almost as much as they fear us?  That you have the<br />
  potential to undermine them?'  Kendr-Saranaxio added something in<br />
  Moridani, which inspired a brief argument between the two xenoforms.<br />
  Kelanie sighed, closed her suit and turned off the cameras.</p>
<p> Kelanie was in the control room of the NoSan'No'Os Freighter that<br />
  they'd hijacked, examining the mass of control-spaces that made up<br />
  the communications panel.  She had read everything that<br />
  Tsiry-Feylen's knowledge-base had to say on the operation of<br />
  NoSan'No'Os equipment, and she thought that she could operate the<br />
  comms system without Tsiry-Feylen finding out.  She looked over her<br />
  notes again, rehearsed the patterns, and then tentatively poked her<br />
  fingers into four holes, one after the other.  Nothing obvious<br />
  happened; she poked a finger and a thumb into the NoSan'No'Os<br />
  equivalent of the `enter' key and the main monitor came to life,<br />
  hissing with vertical streaks of video static.<br />
  There were six particular control-spaces underneath the monitor<br />
  that were concerned with adjusting the frequency of the receiver.<br />
  She played with these for a few minutes, before discovering that they<br />
  only altered the frequency over several pre-set channels, none of<br />
  which were used by the Earth contingent of the NoSan'No'Os.  She<br />
  looked at her notes again, found a reference to a `global frequency<br />
  unlock', activated it.  Now, (apparently), the six control-spaces<br />
  underneath the monitor would range up and down the nano-gravitic<br />
  band, the two outside holes changing the frequency rapidly; the<br />
  innermost holes fine-tuning it.  She was so absorbed in this that she<br />
  didn't notice Kayren glide up behind her.  The Pthalklin Ervae<br />
  watched over her shoulder as she searched through the available<br />
  frequencies for any signal from Earth.  She found a few channels<br />
  saturated with red and green vertical stripes, which she recognised<br />
  as encoded Bythian military transmissions; finally, towards the upper<br />
  end of the frequencies that the Freighter could receive, she found a<br />
  band without noise, which meant that a signal was being transmitted<br />
  on that frequency.  A synthesised voice was counting down, in<br />
  Tertiary, from somewhere around sixty-one thousand, speaking every<br />
  two minutes or so.  A few rapid calculations revealed that, if this<br />
  was a countdown to the asteroids' impact on Earth, they had<br />
  thirty-four hours left.  She jumped nervously as Kayren pushed past<br />
  her, moving closer to the control panel.<br />
  `Like this, Kelanie...' Kayren's translator said.  Three insects-<br />
  each about the size of Kelanie's thumb - floated up to the columns,<br />
  darting in and out of the control-spaces, occasionally flying back to<br />
  the leaf-platforms that were arranged in a fringe just below Kayren's<br />
  pineapple-shaped head to pick up new pheromonal instructions then<br />
  flying up to execute them.  The hissing of the untuned videoscreen<br />
  cleared, revealing a two-dimensional display, red Tertiary text<br />
  against a black background.  Kelanie lifted her video-eyepatch,<br />
  watched as the words blurred and resolved into the Anglic<br />
  translation:</p>
<p> This is a NoSan'No'Os announcement.<br />
  The service you are calling has been discontinued<br />
  due to a breach of the Interdiction laws.</p>
<p> `That is the primary data exchange channel from Earth.' Kayren<br />
  explained.<br />
  `It was.'</p>
<p> Kelanie was in her battle-suit, drifting alongside the NoSan'No'Os<br />
  Freighter bolted to the outside of the Moridani base, floating a few<br />
  metres from the hatchway which Tsiry-Feylen had blasted, tethered by<br />
  a thin plastic cable.  She had gone outside primarily to get away<br />
  from the others, to try and sort out what was going on.  From what<br />
  she had seen, Tsiry-Feylen wasn't deceiving her about the imminent<br />
  destruction of humanity.  What could she do about it?  Ninety years<br />
  of existence under the rule of the NoSan'No'Os had convinced mankind<br />
  of the futility of opposition.  The only thing she could think to do<br />
  was to warn the government - what was left of it - somehow.  She<br />
  heard a tactful `click' over her suit phones as Marek drifted out of<br />
  the hatch to join her.<br />
  `Come back inside, Kelanie.  I feel nervous with you floating<br />
  around out here.'  She reached over and took his suit's hand in hers,<br />
  tugged gently on the tether with her other hand, bouncing off the<br />
  edge of the hatch as they passed through it.  The black glass formed<br />
  behind them as they settled to the deck; air rushed in through vents<br />
  ranked along the bottom of the walls.  Marek opened his suit, climbed<br />
  out after activating a sequence that would command it to walk back to<br />
  the docking bay by itself.  The suit snapped shut, shuffled around<br />
  them both and moved off.  Kelanie, still in her suit, followed Marek<br />
  back to the berth that they'd shared on the journey to the asteroid<br />
  base.  She stopped outside the round doorway, still lost in thought.<br />
  Marek knocked on the front of her suit.<br />
  `Come on out... I know you're in there somewhere.'  Abruptly, the<br />
  suit opened, and Marek reached in, unbuckling the securing straps,<br />
  lifting her out of the suit, trailing monitor leads and cables.  One<br />
  by one, he carefully peeled the contacts from her skin, kissing the<br />
  places where they had been attached.  She hugged him, one arm around<br />
  his neck, running her hand down his back with sudden desperation,<br />
  kissing him and dragging him into the berth, tears beginning to leak<br />
  from beneath her tightly-closed eyelids.  Her hand brushed the keys<br />
  of her notepad, which began to play some soft ambient music, all<br />
  crashing ocean waves, whale song and distant bass tones, as Marek<br />
  stroked open the contact strip that held the front of her jumper<br />
  together, pushing it aside, kissing her breasts and throat.  She lay<br />
  back on the mats which Marek had been sleeping on, breathing deeply,<br />
  biting her lip from the effort of suppressing the despair she felt.<br />
  Three large insects zipped into the room, circled over the entwined<br />
  pair, and, scenting the pheromones, flew out again.</p>
<p> Tsiry-Feylen was silent as she wiggled her fingers in the control-<br />
  spaces on the flight-column of the NoSan'No'Os freighter, which<br />
  turned, backed away from the asteroid (which was still heading<br />
  directly towards Earth), swung around it and overtook it.  Kelanie,<br />
  Marek and Kayren stood behind her, watching the view in front of the<br />
  ship displayed on the main screen.<br />
  Kendr-Saranaxio entered, wearing a battle-suit, Kayren swaying<br />
  slightly to avoid the rhinoceros-sized mass as it passed.  The suit<br />
  cracked open, and Kendr-Saranaxio stepped out, shaking her legs.  She<br />
  said, using two of her voices,<br />
  `We are taking a great risk...' `but we have decided to use<br />
  three-quarters of our offensive potential to divert as many asteroids<br />
  as we can get away with.' `There are three more stolen freighters<br />
  arriving from other parts of the galaxy;' `We intend to lift as many<br />
  humans off Earth as we can,' `...before the Bythians can retaliate.'<br />
  `We are going in first, though, to pick up the cargo we originally<br />
  intended to.'  Marek asked,<br />
  `Weapons?  I didn't think that humanity had any.'  Kendr-Saranaxio<br />
  bared her teeth at him; he grinned back.<br />
  `We have been stockpiling CCI missiles on Earth for the past nine<br />
  years, but we aren't going in for them;' `We have also been<br />
  stockpiling information; history, music, art, that sort of thing.<br />
  That stockpile is our primary concern.'  Tsiry-Feylen said, tersely,<br />
  in Bythian;<br />
  `Yl chuev chto ty valyf, li svayen'e valyf.'  Kendr-Saranaxio<br />
  replied,<br />
  `If it is a mistake, we don't think that there will be time to feel<br />
  embarrassed about it.'  She turned to the two humans and said,<br />
  apologetically,  `My sister has been living safely on Millimillenary<br />
  for so long that she has lost her sense of adventure.'  Tsiry-Feylen<br />
  retorted sardonically,<br />
  `My sister has been out gun-running in the asteroids for so long<br />
  that she has lost her sense of proportion with regard to risk-<br />
  evaluation.'  Kendr-Saranaxio held up a hand, extended one finger<br />
  then another, withdrawing them both; the Kaelen antennae-signal that<br />
  represented amusement.  Tsiry-Feylen activated a bank of six monitors<br />
  to her left, screens filled with vertically-run static that faded to<br />
  reveal views along the side of the Freighter.  Tsiry-Feylen<br />
  explained,<br />
  `Missiles.  We will send them ahead of us, in case there are any<br />
  Bythians lurking around.  We will leave them in orbit while we go<br />
  down for the cargo.'  Each view shuddered and changed in turn as the<br />
  missiles were launched, accelerating furiously, the bright star that<br />
  was their destination swelling appreciably as they watched.<br />
  Kendr-Saranaxio said,<br />
  `You humans can feel proud of those missiles; the drives were<br />
  stolen from the NoSan'No'Os, as were the CCI warheads, but control<br />
  for each missile is provided by prototype artificial intelligences,<br />
  developed on Earth.' `...so you can begin to understand why the<br />
  NoSan'No'Os fear you... would you like to chat with a missile?'<br />
  Kelanie, relieved that something was going to be done to avert the<br />
  holocaust that she still couldn't encompass, grinned at Marek.<br />
  `What can you say to a missile?  Good-bye?'</p>

<p> How to: Show a Kaelen that you appreciate the joke it<br />
  told you</p>
<p> If you don't have antennae, use your fingers.  It isn't<br />
  necessary to hold them up next to your temples; make a<br />
  fist, extend your index finger, then extend your little<br />
  finger while withdrawing the index finger; then withdraw<br />
  the little finger into your fist again.  A significant<br />
  delay between the index and little finger movements is<br />
  interpreted as sarcasm, so be careful.</p>
<p> - `Let's Speak Kaelen', Chapter One</p>
<p> The ExPort appeared deserted.  A scrap of paper blew out of one of<br />
  the gaping hangar doors, across the concrete oval of the landing pad.<br />
  It fluttered, and then was swept aside as the NoSan'No'Os freighter<br />
  settled to the pad as softly as a balloon.  A ramp extruded from the<br />
  pad, extending upwards to the hatch that opened just as the ramp<br />
  reached the ship.  Two Moridani battle-suits ran down the ramp,<br />
  across the ExPort and into the hangar, followed by two smaller<br />
  battle-suits.<br />
  `They're not here yet!'  Kelanie scanned with her boom-mounted<br />
  cameras, moving aside as Tsiry-Feylen ran out of the hangar, followed<br />
  by six crates that floated ten centimetres off the ground.  Kelanie<br />
  moved into the hangar, which looked like it had been the subject of a<br />
  raid conducted by heavy earth-moving gear; cubicles and desks pushed<br />
  over to one side of the building, two gaping holes in the back wall.<br />
  Crates were piled conspicuously in the bare centre of the floor.<br />
  Kendr-Saranaxio was darting from one crate to another, checking<br />
  labels, occasionally slapping a crate on the side.  When she did<br />
  this, the crate lifted from the ground and floated towards one of the<br />
  holes in the back wall.  Curious, Kelanie walked around to the rear<br />
  of the hangar, and watched in fascination as the crates floated in<br />
  single file to a landing pad, where they popped open, revealing a<br />
  white metal sphere about a metre in diameter.  The spheres rotated,<br />
  aligning themselves with some invisible signal, and then shot off<br />
  into the sky.  Faint thunder of a series of distant sonic booms<br />
  sounded from above.  The last of the spheres executed an impossibly<br />
  sharp right-angle turn just after it launched, darting off behind<br />
  Kelanie.  She turned, and seeing a distant speck in the sky,<br />
  increased the magnification of her suit camera.<br />
  It couldn't be a NoSan'No'Os craft; it was moving too slowly.  It<br />
  resembled a bus, painted in camouflage green and brown, with two hazy<br />
  circles wavering over each end.  The sphere shot towards the machine,<br />
  taking up a position underneath it.  Kelanie ran back to the hangar,<br />
  where Kendr-Saranaxio was giving loading instructions to the crates.<br />
  `Someone's coming - I think it might be my friends.'  Kendr-<br />
  Saranaxio slapped the last crate, which lifted, spun around and<br />
  floated off towards the freighter.<br />
  `According to the telemetry from the missile, it's an antique<br />
  helicopter, human technology, three people on board.  It has only<br />
  shortwave electronic radio, which we don't have transceivers for.'<br />
  She ran back outside, to where Marek's suit stood open.  Marek angled<br />
  the suit back, staring at the sky, wrinkling his nose in distaste.<br />
  `This air smells funny.'  he said.  She beckoned to him as the<br />
  helicopter approached, dipping unevenly towards the grass next to the<br />
  freighter.  The rear rotor cut out completely, dropping the machine<br />
  to the ground from a height of about three meters, the chassis<br />
  crumpling slightly as it hit.  Marek snapped his suit shut and<br />
  Kelanie ducked as the 'copter tilted over on one side, the rotors<br />
  chopping into the ground, snapping off and flying in all directions,<br />
  the craft shaking like an animal in the throes of some haemotoxic<br />
  poison.  When it had finally settled, the rear of the machine opened<br />
  haltingly, then broke off.  Three figures jumped out, freezing when<br />
  they saw the battle-suits approaching.  Kelanie shouted through her<br />
  suit's external speaker,<br />
  `Gen?  Gaeren?'</p>
<p> Some ninety thousand kilometres away, a Bythian scout flew a<br />
  parallel course to a roughly egg-shaped, nickel-iron asteroid,<br />
  thirty-two kilometres along its longitudinal axis, turning<br />
  end-over-end once every twenty-one minutes.  Occasionally, the<br />
  Bythian navigator glanced over the radar display, not expecting to<br />
  see anything, but keeping watch all the same.<br />
  Suddenly, it spotted three blips on the extreme edge of the radar<br />
  field.  At the next sweep, there were fifteen blips.  It didn't waste<br />
  any time; it thrust fingers into control-spaces, launching a volley<br />
  of missiles, each no larger than a football, designed simply to get<br />
  in front of a target and disintegrate, leaving a cluster of debris<br />
  moving at high speed.  As soon as the missiles were away, the blips<br />
  scattered, changing course with a smoothness only possible for ships<br />
  driven by NoSan'No'Os impeller engines.  The Bythian immediately sent<br />
  an alarm to Threat Termination Control, but before it could specify<br />
  the nature of the problem, the first blip had arrived at its<br />
  destination, directly between the asteroid and the scout.  It paused<br />
  there for a moment, and the Navigator considered lobbing some more<br />
  missiles at it when it vanished in a pinpoint of white light, a flare<br />
  of vaporised rock spreading out from the leading shoulder of the<br />
  asteroid.  The navigator didn't bother throwing its arms up in front<br />
  of its face, which would have been a useless gesture; its last act<br />
  was to launch all its missiles in the general direction of the line<br />
  of blips; three projectiles made it out of the scout's launching bay<br />
  before a hail of asteroid-fragments riddled the ship, tearing it to<br />
  pieces.  The Bythian didn't survive to see the other fourteen blips<br />
  reach their target and detonate, each pushing the asteroid several<br />
  degrees off its course.<br />
</p>
<p> `Remember: military targets only! Be sure you hit nothing<br />
  except bases, dumps, roads, factories, bridges, trains,<br />
  ships, houses, fields, forests, buildings, vehicles, or<br />
  anything else that may look suspicious.'<br />
  - Handelsman</p>
<p> Tsiry-Feylen was in the freighter, talking with two other Moridani<br />
  who were on their way to Earth.<br />
  `It's going to be a &lt;nightmare&gt;,' she said with a degree of<br />
  disgust.  `Kendr-Saranaxio is getting sentimental... anyway, it<br />
  appears that there are almost twice as many asteroids as we accounted<br />
  for, so by the time you get here, the planet will be a disaster<br />
  area... the system will be swarming with Bythians... we're tempted to<br />
  cut and run.'<br />
  `The first wave of diversion-missiles will have reached their<br />
  targets by now; what is the latest projection with regards to Threat<br />
  Termination finding out what's going on?'  Tsiry-Feylen transmitted a<br />
  complex, four-dimensional data-structure, showing how many of the<br />
  eight hundred and ten scouts nurse-maiding the projectiles were<br />
  expected to survive the detonation of the diversion-missiles and what<br />
  the chances were of any of the survivors being able to report.<br />
  `We agree... it *_is_* going to be a &lt;nightmare&gt;.  We will have to<br />
  arrange temporary living quarters for, how many?' `eleven hundred.'<br />
  `eleven hundred humans, on Triple-S and Beckett.  We can't see that<br />
  many humans co-existing peacefully inside NoSan'No'Os freighters for<br />
  more than a &lt;week&gt;.'  Tsiry-Feylen narrowed her eyes, grinning.<br />
  `Maybe that is just what we need.'  She closed the connection,<br />
  instructed her suit to take her outside, to check on the cargo<br />
  loading.  She saw the five humans sitting on the edge of the loading<br />
  ramp, and waved as she passed, grinning to herself when she saw the<br />
  looks of surprise on the faces of Kelanie's friends.<br />
  Kelanie had been fielding their questions, assisted by Marek and<br />
  the odd comment thrown in by Kendr-Saranaxio as she ran past, herding<br />
  crates into the freighter.  Gaeren Tuuri, a tall, thin neuter who had<br />
  worked with Kelanie in the Bureau of Procuration, was describing the<br />
  chaos that the NoSan'No'Os withdrawal had produced.<br />
  `It was like a mob of children who'd just been let out of school...<br />
  what surprised me was the number of murders that occurred; you don't<br />
  realise just how violent most people are underneath the thin veneer<br />
  of civilisation...' he shuddered.  Genesis, one of Kelanie's<br />
  associates from her days in the `AnarchArtist' Terrorist/ Absurdist<br />
  organisation, was scanning through the notes she'd collected during<br />
  her stay on Millimillenary.  He'd found a picture of the<br />
  Bythian-hired assassin, the one they'd called the `Barber'.<br />
  `This... up until three weeks ago, there were dozens of these Xenos<br />
  all over the place, accompanied by squads of Bythians.'  Mileva<br />
  Barker, ex-AV thief and street-gang leader, had taken a liking to<br />
  Marek; Kelanie felt obliged to warn her, in low-level street talk, to<br />
  be careful with him, `... or else you will have me to answer to.'<br />
  Tsiry-Feylen noted that the Hangar was now empty; she turned back<br />
  to the ship, stopping at the ramp and opening up her suit.  She<br />
  resisted the impulse to bare her teeth at Kelanie's friends.<br />
  `Unless you are expecting anyone else, we should go.  It appears<br />
  that we haven't been one hundred percent successful in stopping the<br />
  asteroids, and our best estimates give us less than half an hour to<br />
  get clear.  We have successfully diverted approximately six hundred<br />
  and fifty of the eight hundred and ten projectiles; the remaining few<br />
  have been blown off course, but we can't be sure exactly where<br />
  they'll land until they enter the atmosphere, because the Bythian<br />
  scouts that survived the attacks have been trying to push them back<br />
  on course.'  Kendr-Saranaxio joined them, opening her suit (and<br />
  scaring Mileva by grinning broadly, scraping her teeth together and<br />
  producing the sound which Kelanie had once compared to that of knives<br />
  being sharpened).<br />
  `Baylal-Delvoy-Kendr-Teff reports that there are some military<br />
  transports on their way from Bythe Prime...' `... and you can believe<br />
  that they aren't just stopping by to say &quot;hello&quot;...' `we have<br />
  allocated the rest of the diversion-missiles to targeting the<br />
  remaining scouts, so, with a degree of luck, all the asteroids will<br />
  miss Earth, giving us enough time to get as many people off as we can<br />
  fit into two NoSan'No'Os freighters.'  Kelanie said,<br />
  `Didn't you say that there were three freighters on their way?'<br />
  Kendr-Saranaxio narrowed her eyes, abruptly closed her suit and ran<br />
  up the ramp into the ship.  Tsiry-Feylen hissed, exposing her fangs,<br />
  the hands of her suit clenching and unclenching, and then turned to<br />
  run after Kendr-Saranaxio.  There was a moment of embarrassed<br />
  silence.  Marek hefted the case of hand-weapons which Mileva had<br />
  stolen from the museum (in which they'd found the helicopter), and<br />
  started up the ramp after the two Moridani.<br />
  `Come on.'  Kelanie, the last one up the ramp, paused in the<br />
  hatchway and turned to look at the ExPort one last time.  A twinkling<br />
  light far off in the sky caught her attention; she closed her suit,<br />
  aimed a boom-mounted camera in the general direction of the light,<br />
  magnified the view.  It appeared to be moving downwards slowly and as<br />
  she watched, glowing fragments broke off and spun away.  She blew<br />
  into the voice-activated microphone, and said,<br />
  `Tsiry-Feylen?  Can you see that object in the sky to the east of<br />
  us?'  There was a pause, after which the ramp fell away and the hatch<br />
  closed, almost chopping off the end of Kelanie's boom-mounted camera.<br />
  She stumbled back slightly as the ship lifted.<br />
  `Kelanie, secure yourself... we have a projectile coming in on us.'<br />
  Tsiry-Feylen said.<br />
  `An asteroid?'  She instructed her suit to run back to the<br />
  freighter's control room, passing her friends on the way there, while<br />
  she tried to find an external camera that could show her the<br />
  projectile in any detail.  She could hear fragments of conversation,<br />
  the choppiness of the voice-activated microphones becoming annoyingly<br />
  obvious as she tried to filter some meaning out of the words:<br />
  `-primary diversion was successful, at least it's not going to hit<br />
  the residential area-'<br />
  `-ing thing IS going to hit US, though, if we don't get moving NOW!<br />
  Kelanie, are you secured?'  She halted her suit's headlong rush,<br />
  threw herself down to lie spread-eagled on the floor, hands and feet<br />
  locking against the sides of the corridor.<br />
  `Yes, I'm secure - what's going to -'  She heard a thump, which,<br />
  even through the walls of the ship, was obviously somewhere below<br />
  them, followed by a jarring blow which hit her in the stomach as the<br />
  ship was buffeted by the strike.  Had she been standing at the time,<br />
  she would have ended up at the far end of the corridor in a heap. The<br />
  ship rocked like a leaf over a bonfire as she scrambled to her feet,<br />
  stumbling down the passage.<br />
  In the control room, her friends were clustered in a corner, while<br />
  the two Moridani stood at the control columns, busily directing their<br />
  dwindling supply of intelligent missiles towards their targets.  One<br />
  of Tsiry-Feylen's component personalities took the time to inform<br />
  them:<br />
  `It looks bad, children - the NAPAIsub for this system caught on to<br />
  us quickly... they are definitely worried about you.'  Kelanie, still<br />
  in her suit, went to a column off to one side, out of the Moridani's<br />
  way.  She patched her suit's display into the control column and<br />
  sorted through the various views available from outside monitors,<br />
  eventually finding one that showed the Earth below them.  There was a<br />
  turbulent grey field of cloud directly underneath them where the<br />
  asteroid had hit.  Her eyes widened as two more projectiles passed<br />
  by, on parallel courses, glowing an angry red colour; one of them<br />
  less than fifty metres from the ship.  Something zipped across the<br />
  screen, curving to track the nearer of the two asteroids, which were<br />
  dwindling rapidly in the distance.  There was an intense white flare,<br />
  momentarily rendering everything in stark black shadows; when it had<br />
  faded, the first asteroid, chunks breaking away, was drifting towards<br />
  its companion.  As Kelanie increased the magnification to keep them<br />
  in view, they collided, the first asteroid breaking up into four<br />
  smaller pieces, the second pushed off course.  She opened her suit,<br />
  sitting it down on its knees, staring at the screen as it tracked the<br />
  asteroid until it hit, on the edge of the residential block about<br />
  five kilometres from the ExPort.  The view, which was already heavily<br />
  aliased due to the extreme magnification, became completely obscured<br />
  by dust, but she knew that anyone in that part of residential block<br />
  would be dead.  She looked up at Tsiry-Feylen, despairingly.<br />
  `Isn't there anything we can do?'  Tsiry-Feylen kept flicking her<br />
  fingers in and out of the control-spaces, and replied tersely,<br />
  `There is, and we are doing it.  If you would like to help, go down<br />
  to the secondary cargo bay and look for a crate marked &quot;vayasch<br />
  cheyr&quot;.  We'd hate to think that it got left behind.'<br />

<p> Kayren, being more familiar with NoSan'No'Os equipment, was able to<br />
  get a patch from the multitude of transmissions that the Moridani<br />
  were receiving from their smart missiles, scattered throughout nearby<br />
  space.  The humans sat in the cargo bay and watched as the Pthalklin<br />
  Ervae expertly adjusted a multi-screen holographic display, the views<br />
  changing every thirty seconds.   Most of them were incomprehensible;<br />
  some were streaked with the dot-patterns that the Moridani used for<br />
  telemetry; others were blank, or obscured by static.  Whenever they<br />
  found an interesting view, they froze the display on that channel<br />
  until the missile that was sending it was destroyed.  Kelanie sat<br />
  behind the others, in her battle suit, her hands clenched around the<br />
  grips of the hand-manipulator controls.  They were getting a<br />
  fragmentary view of the carnage that the Moridani had been unable to<br />
  prevent; huge chunks of rock ploughing into heavily-populated centres<br />
  with the strength of atomic weapons, the shock waves knocking<br />
  buildings flat in circles for kilometres around.  She tried to treat<br />
  it like some sort of documentary special-effect, but it didn't make<br />
  her feel any better.  After watching the eighth or ninth city being<br />
  demolished, she slammed her suit shut and stamped out.  Momentarily,<br />
  Marek turned as if to follow her, but couldn't think of anything<br />
  reassuring to say, and instead folded himself up behind a crate, his<br />
  head in his hands.</p>
<p> When she got to the control room, both Moridani were motionless,<br />
  watching a single monitor on which telemetry information flashed past<br />
  at a rate too fast for her translator to even register.<br />
  `Tsiry-Feylen?  What's happening?'  No answer.  She walked her suit<br />
  over to stand between the xenos, opened it.  Their attention didn't<br />
  waver.  Kelanie sat in her suit, trying for a minute to decide<br />
  whether interrupt them.  She was about to speak again when both<br />
  turned sharply to look at each other, baring their teeth and hissing;<br />
  a display that almost made Kelanie's hair stand on end.<br />
  Kendr-Saranaxio stretched, shaking her rear legs, and Tsiry-Feylen<br />
  said,<br />
  `We think we may have just halted Earth's NAPAISub.  If we have<br />
  succeeded, then we stand a chance of getting those nine hundred<br />
  people off Earth safely.'  Kendr-Saranaxio opened a communications<br />
  channel to one of the other stolen NoSan'No'Os freighters, began<br />
  chatting with another Moridani.  Tsiry-Feylen took Kelanie aside, sat<br />
  on one of their grey patterned rugs, her legs folding neatly<br />
  underneath.   `We gravely underestimated the importance that the<br />
  NoSan'No'Os placed on your extermination.  We had been monitoring the<br />
  communications between the NAPAISubs, but it appears that this<br />
  exercise was planned privately between the local NAPAISub and NAPAI.<br />
  We have managed to get both freighters down on Earth and fully<br />
  loaded... we are now waiting for an opening before we can lift them<br />
  to safety.'  Kelanie felt an ache behind her eyes, matched by a<br />
  nervous feeling in her stomach, as if she were about to perform on<br />
  stage in front of thousands of people.  Tsiry-Feylen was watching her<br />
  closely.  Kelanie said in a small voice,<br />
  `You've seen this happen before, haven't you?'<br />
  `Six times.  This is the third time we've been involved in an<br />
  rescue.  We have some idea of the anguish you are experiencing.'<br />
  Kelanie closed her eyes as the feeling got worse.  `We don't cry, but<br />
  if we could, we would.'  The semi-nauseous feeling vanished, abruptly<br />
  replaced by anger.<br />
  `I would have thought that you'd be used to it by now.'  she<br />
  sneered.  Tsiry-Feylen raised an index finger in warning.<br />
  `We had friends on Earth, too.  Don't, for one minute, think that<br />
  you have some sort of monopoly on grief around here.  Start to think<br />
  that when you have seen this game played out a few more times, when<br />
  you have seen more sentient beings killed than you thought existed.<br />
  Start to think that when the NoSan'No'Os are hunting for you,<br />
  personally, and will kill anyone who gets in their way to find you.<br />
  Start to think that when you find that you cannot trust anyone, or<br />
  befriend anyone, for fear that they will be killed by the<br />
  NoSan'No'Os.'  Kelanie stared up at the alien for a moment, then<br />
  broke the contact by abruptly shutting her suit and running off down<br />
  the corridor.</p>
<p> She found herself in the corridor where she had back-handed the<br />
  Bythian, almost severing its head.  She opened her suit, undid the<br />
  securing straps and stood up in it, bringing her head level with a<br />
  yellow stain on the white ceramic wall.  Bythian blood.  She reached<br />
  out and ran her fingers over it, idly scraping some of it off with<br />
  her fingernails.  She heard someone - Marek, judging from the sound<br />
  of his bare feet - approaching.  She laid her hand flat against the<br />
  wall, turned to face him.  In the short time that he had known her,<br />
  Marek had never seen her with an expression like the one she<br />
  presented now.  It was a look that conveyed icy, relentless resolve;<br />
  the look of obsession.<br />
  `We will give them good reason to fear us.' she said.<br />
